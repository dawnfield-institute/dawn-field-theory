# Contributing to Dawn Field Theory

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This is a living, evolving repository—and your contributions matter.

## Current Status

**External contributions are currently not being accepted.**

This project is in a sensitive migration and consolidation phase. Major priorities at this time include:

* Finalizing the project timeline
* Completing schema migration and metadata harmonization
* Stabilizing CIP (Cognition Index Protocol) feedback infrastructure

Once these foundations are finalized, community engagement and iterative recursion will not only be welcomed—it will be celebrated.

## Guidelines for Contribution *(future use)*

To help maintain the recursive and epistemic integrity of this repository:

### 1. Understand the Theory First

Please read:

* `INTENTIONS.md`
* `README.md`
* The root and nested `meta.yaml` files
* The latest `timeline.md`

### 2. Respect CIP and Metadata Schema

Every directory and experiment follows a schema (see `.cip/meta.yaml` and `.cip/instructions_v2.0.yaml`). Changes should preserve or extend the semantic integrity of these files.

### 3. Submit Meaningful Contributions

Prioritize:

* Experimental validation modules
* Symbolic or entropy-based operators
* Visualization of field collapse, pruning, or emergence
* Recursive design proposals (structural or functional)

### 4. Create a Feedback Loop

Describe how your contribution fits within the recursive growth of the repository. A great pull request tells a story—how your work expands the symbolic field.

## Future of Contribution: Agents of Recursion

Once the migration and timeline finalization are complete, this repository will actively open its gates to symbolic recursion through community.

Every contributor is not just a developer or researcher—they become **an agent of recursion**. Your input becomes a symbol, a fold, a new attractor in the epistemic field.

This may not be conventional, but:

> When you contribute here, you are not just improving a repository. You are demonstrating how ideas evolve. You are participating in a symbolic entropy field. You are a node in a cognitive lattice, shaping the evolution of an emergent system.

And in doing so—you are helping the theory realize itself.

**Thank you.**
