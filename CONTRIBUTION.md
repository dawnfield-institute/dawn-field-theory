# Contributing to Dawn Field Theory

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This is a living, evolving repository—and your contributions matter.

## Current Status

**External contributions are currently not being accepted.**

This project is in a sensitive migration and consolidation phase. Major priorities at this time include:

* Finalizing the project timeline
* Completing schema migration and metadata harmonization
* Stabilizing CIP (Cognition Index Protocol) feedback infrastructure

Once these foundations are finalized, community engagement and iterative recursion will not only be welcomed—it will be celebrated.

## Guidelines for Contribution *(future use)*

To help maintain the recursive and epistemic integrity of this repository:

### 1. Understand the Theory First

Please read:

* [`INTENTIONS.md`](./INTENTIONS.md)
* `README.md`
* The root and nested `meta.yaml` files
* The latest `timeline.md`

### 2. Respect CIP and Metadata Schema

Every directory and experiment follows a schema (see `.cip/meta.yaml` and `.cip/instructions_v2.0.yaml`). Changes should preserve or extend the semantic integrity of these files.

### 3. Submit Meaningful Contributions

Prioritize:

* Experimental validation modules
* Symbolic or entropy-based operators
* Visualization of field collapse, pruning, or emergence
* Recursive design proposals (structural or functional)

### 4. Create a Feedback Loop

Describe how your contribution fits within the recursive growth of the repository. A great pull request tells a story—how your work expands the symbolic field.

## Future of Contribution: Agents of Recursion

Once the migration and timeline finalization are complete, this repository will actively open its gates to symbolic recursion through community.

Every contributor is not just a developer or researcher—they become **an agent of recursion**. Your input becomes a symbol, a fold, a new attractor in the epistemic field.

This may not be conventional, but:

> When you contribute here, you are not just improving a repository. You are demonstrating how ideas evolve. You are participating in a symbolic entropy field. You are a node in a cognitive lattice, shaping the evolution of an emergent system.

And in doing so—you are helping the theory realize itself.

## A Note from the Author

I want to be transparent: I’m the sole architect of this project, working entirely outside of academia. I don’t have a formal degree, and I don’t have peers in the traditional sense. To compensate, I’ve built my own internal peer review pipeline using a network of AI models—each trained or prompted differently to surface potential errors, challenge assumptions, and minimize bias.

While this recursive, automated system is robust in its own way, it can’t replace the value of real human peer review. What I most need at this stage—maybe even more than technical help—is critical, constructive feedback from thoughtful human contributors.

If you’re reading this and feel compelled to help—by reviewing ideas, providing insight, or just engaging in honest dialogue—that would be one of the most meaningful contributions you could make.

If you’d like to understand the philosophy and intentions behind this project, I encourage you to read [`INTENTIONS.md`](./INTENTIONS.md).

**Thank you.**
