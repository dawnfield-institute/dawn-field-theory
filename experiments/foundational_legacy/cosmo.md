# cosmo.py

## Overview

The `cosmo.py` script simulates a simplified model of cosmic evolution, focusing on the expansion and contraction dynamics of a virtual universe. This simulation serves as an experimental platform to explore foundational concepts in cosmology within the framework of the Dawn Field Theory.

## Purpose

This script aims to:

- Model a universe undergoing cycles of expansion and contraction.
- Explore the implications of entropy behavior across cosmic cycles.
- Provide a computational tool to visualize and analyze cosmological dynamics.

## Implementation Details

- **Universe Class**: Encapsulates properties such as size, expansion rate, and matter distribution.
- **Simulation Loop**: Iteratively updates the universe's state over discrete time steps, applying rules that dictate expansion or contraction.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Computes entropy at each step to study its evolution over time.
- **Visualization**: Outputs data suitable for plotting the universe's size and entropy over time.

## Theoretical Foundations

The simulation is informed by the following theoretical concepts:

- **Cyclic Cosmology**: The universe undergoes infinite cycles of expansion and contraction, challenging the traditional notion of a singular beginning.
- **Entropy Dynamics**: Investigates how entropy behaves across cycles, ensuring consistency with thermodynamic laws.

These concepts are elaborated in the foundational documents within the repository.

## Usage

To run the simulation:

```bash
python cosmo.py
