## Overview

The `brain.py` script simulates neural network dynamics, modeling the behavior of interconnected neurons over time. It serves as an experimental platform to study emergent properties of neural systems, drawing from theoretical concepts in neuroscience and computational models.

## Purpose

This script aims to:

- Replicate the firing patterns and signal propagation in a simplified neural network.
- Explore how neural structures can give rise to complex behaviors.
- Provide a sandbox for experimenting with neural dynamics and learning mechanisms.

## Implementation Details

- **Neuron Class**: Models individual neurons with properties such as membrane potential, threshold, and refractory period.
- **Synapse Class**: Represents connections between neurons, handling signal transmission and synaptic strength.
- **Network Initialization**: Constructs a network of neurons with specified connectivity patterns.
- **Simulation Loop**: Advances the network state over time, updating neuron states based on inputs and synaptic interactions.
- **Data Logging**: Records neuron firing events and membrane potentials for analysis.

## Theoretical Foundations

The simulation is informed by the following theoretical concepts:

- **Integrate-and-Fire Neuron Models**: Simplified representations of neuronal behavior focusing on membrane potential dynamics.
- **Synaptic Plasticity**: Mechanisms by which synaptic strengths are adjusted based on activity, crucial for learning and memory.
- **Emergent Dynamics**: Study of how complex patterns arise from simple interactions within neural networks.

These concepts are elaborated in the foundational documents within the repository.

## Usage

To run the simulation:

```bash
python brain.py
