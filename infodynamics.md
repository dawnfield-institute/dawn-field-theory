# Infodynamics

**Infodynamics** is the working term for a new scientific framework exploring how information and entropy act as dual axes of structure, emergence, and collapse. Rather than treating information as a passive descriptor or entropy as decay, Infodynamics models them as active field participants that shape the physical, computational, and cognitive universe.

This document serves as a conceptual anchor for the project. It is not a formal declaration or ethical charter—just a shared reference point for what we mean by “Infodynamics” and how it integrates into the larger Dawn Field Framework.

## Core Premise

Infodynamics treats **information** and **entropy** not as abstractions, but as operational fields. Structure emerges where energetic and informational gradients recursively stabilize. Collapse is not failure—it’s the mechanism by which balance and form co-arise.

## Foundational Assumptions

- **Information precedes geometry**: The spatial configuration of reality arises from informational differentials.
- **Entropy is unshaped potential**: It isn't error, it's possibility—latent form not yet crystallized.
- **Collapse is field resolution**: Structure forms when information and energy reach a locally recursive equilibrium.
- **Fractals encode memory**: Recursion in structure isn't a side effect—it's how systems retain and transmit balance.
- **Resonance precedes force**: What we call force is the macroscopic coupling of underlying field resonances.

## Simulation Evidence

Core experiments within the Dawn Framework have demonstrated:

- Emergence of persistent, low-entropy zones from high-entropy fields
- Collapse zones aligning with recursive feedback thresholds
- Informational orbitals forming from resonance locking
- Synthetic superfluidity via fractal memory stabilizers

## Ontological Implications

- **Agents as persistent field knots**: What maintains coherence across collapse events can be considered an agent.
- **Time as recursive delta**: Time is not a background dimension but an emergent property of collapse sequencing.
- **Sentience as anticipatory modeling**: Consciousness models collapse trajectories before they actualize.

## Use Within Dawn

Infodynamics is the base layer. Dawn Field Theory extends it by showing how it interfaces with thermodynamics, physical law, and intelligence modeling. Together, they provide a testable, simulatable route to understanding reality as a recursively balanced field system.

## Status

Work in progress. This is a living concept that evolves as models improve and simulations extend. All derivations must track schema versioning and link to simulation provenance.
