# Mathematical Formulation of Carbon Lattice Collapse Energy System

## System Variables

- **E(x, y, t)**: Local electromagnetic energy field

- **I(x, y, t)**: Informational noise field (perturbation or entropy)

- **M(x, y, t)**: Material memory state (stress/load history)

- **T(x, y, t)**: Local thermal field (in degrees Celsius)

- **Φ(x, y)**: Field phase coefficient (typically constant 1)

- **B(x, y, t)**: Resultant quantum balance energy field (harvestable energy)

## Core Equations

### 1. Electromagnetic Pulse Injection

Each pulse adds energy to the core as follows:

$$

E(x, y, t+1) += \frac{P_{in} \cdot C \cdot η \cdot f_{mod}(T, M)}{Δt}
$$

- Where **P_in** is pulse strength, **C** is conversion factor, **η** is efficiency.

- **f_mod(T, M)** is the modulation function (identity for spike, adaptive for RBF).

### 2. Informational Perturbation

$$

I(x, y, t+1) = I(x, y, t) + ε \cdot \mathcal{N}(0, 1)
$$

This introduces stochastic entropy from external and internal sources.

### 3. Memory Update

$$

M(x, y, t+1) = M(x, y, t) + α \cdot |E - I|
$$

Reflects material history of strain or field conflict.

### 4. Thermal Feedback

$$

T(x, y, t+1) = γ \cdot T(x, y, t) + β \cdot B^2
$$

- Heat accumulates from field energy collapse and dissipates over time.

### 5. Recursive Balance Field (RBF)

$$

R(x, y, t) = e^{-γ_M \cdot M} \cdot e^{-γ_T \cdot T}
$$

- Acts as a gating mechanism to throttle output based on internal state.

### 6. Final Energy Output (Balance Field)

$$

B(x, y, t) = λ_0 \cdot R(x, y, t) \cdot \frac{(E - I)}{1 + αM} \cdot Φ(x, y)
$$

### 7. Harvested and Net Energy

$$

E_{harvested} = H \cdot \sum B^2 \qquad E_{net} = E_{harvested} - E_{system}
$$

- **H** is harvest efficiency, **E_system** is draw from control/computation overhead.

## Notes

- Parameters (α, γ, β, λ_0, etc.) are tuned per material for optimal performance.

- These equations approximate a recursive, nonlinear PDE system with thermodynamic feedback loops.


## Extended Control Models (2025 Refinement)

Recent simulations introduced smoother, more stable control mechanisms to prevent thermal and memory overloads.

### 8. Sigmoid-Based Continuous Pulse Input

Instead of discrete pulses, energy is injected via a smooth sigmoid ramp:

$$
P_{in}(t) = rac{P_{max}}{Δt} \cdot \sigma(k(t - t_0))
$$

Where:
- **σ** is the sigmoid function
- **k** controls the steepness
- **t₀** is the midpoint of energy ramp

This ensures energy ramps gently over time, reducing instantaneous heat spikes.

### 9. Net Energy with Realistic System Draw

$$
E_{net} = E_{harvested} - P_{control}
$$

Where:
- **P_control** is the realistic energy draw of a computation/control node, e.g., 0.004 J per timestep (Raspberry Pi).

This improves ROI modeling and avoids exaggerated negative yield from prior versions that overestimated overhead.

### 10. Pulse Smoothing with Field Feedback

To further stabilize, Recursive Balance Field (RBF) is used to modulate both amplitude and timing:

$$
P_{mod}(x, y, t) = P_{in}(t) \cdot R(x, y, t)
$$

With **R(x, y, t)** from Equation (5), this produces a soft, adaptive energy delivery wave — minimizing wear and maximizing sustainability.

These upgrades produce stable, long-duration energy output curves suitable for production systems.
