## üß¨ Core Concept

Traditional batteries and fuel cells rely on chemical reactions.  
**Balance-based energy generation** uses electromagnetic pulses to disrupt the internal informational balance of a carbon lattice, releasing energy as both electromagnetic and thermal output.  
Key features:
- **Recursive Balance Field (RBF):** Real-time feedback modulates pulse strength and timing for safety and efficiency
- **Programmable Control:** Supports multi-pulse, sigmoid, and oscillatory energy injection for different use cases
- **Material Intelligence:** Carbon substrates act as both energy storage and computation medium

## üß™ What‚Äôs Inside

### Theory & Models

- **Quantum Balance Equation (QBE):** Governs energy-information conversion
- **RBF & Adaptive Control:** Enables self-regulation, prevents overheating, and maximizes net output
- **Sigmoid & Oscillatory Control:** Smooth, sustainable energy delivery for long-duration or critical systems

### Simulations

- **v1:** Baseline QBE and RBF models, multi-zone and chaotic scenarios ([balance_based_energy_generationv1.py](balance_based_energy_generationv1.py))
- **v2:** Tuned material parameters, advanced feedback, and comparative analysis ([balance_based_energy_generationv2.py](balance_based_energy_generationv2.py))
- **Strategy Logs:** Extended tests with sigmoid and gentle sigmoid control ([carbon_energy_strategy_logs.py](carbon_energy_strategy_logs.py))

### Results

- **Graphite:** Best for cheap, high-burst output (spike mode)
- **Graphene:** Balanced, safe, and efficient under RBF or sigmoid control
- **CNTs:** Peak output and efficiency, ideal for high-performance or aerospace use
- **Sigmoid/Gentle Sigmoid:** Most stable for long-term, regulated energy delivery
