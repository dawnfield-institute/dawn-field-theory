# üß† Blueprints Directory

This directory contains early-stage **architectures**, **protocols**, and **technical concepts** developed alongside the core DAWN Field Theory and Infodynamics framework.

While the rest of this repository focuses on simulation, theoretical grounding, and natural law experiments, the contents here represent **practical system designs** and **potentially applicable technologies** ‚Äî things like communication protocols, cognition evaluators, agentic infrastructures, and more.

## üîç What You'll Find Here

These are documents and designs that:
- Explore **how to implement** the ideas from the main framework
- Sketch out future tools, platforms, and interfaces
- May form the basis of future standalone modules or projects

### Example inclusions:
- `qsocket.md`: A resonance-based communication protocol for distributed cognitive systems
- `cognition_index_protocol.md`: A proposed system for measuring machine understanding through question scaffolding
- `agentic_framework_outline.md`: Concept architecture for a future agentic cognitive model

## üöß What This Folder Is For

This folder is intended to:
- Provide **a home for in-progress, applied ideas**
- Let others explore, comment on, or even build upon these ideas with transparency
- Give me the room to move forward confidently without worrying about idea appropriation

Many of these ideas are still evolving ‚Äî and this is a way to open them up to **dialogue, exploration, and future development**, without locking them into premature implementation or hiding them behind closed doors.
