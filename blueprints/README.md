# üß† Blueprints Directory

This directory contains early-stage **architectures**, **protocols**, and **technical concepts** developed alongside the core DAWN Field Theory and Infodynamics framework.

While the rest of this repository focuses on simulation, theoretical grounding, and natural law experiments, the contents here represent **practical system designs** and **potentially applicable technologies** ‚Äî things like communication protocols, cognition evaluators, agentic infrastructures, and more.

## üîç What You'll Find Here

These are documents and designs that:
- Explore **how to implement** the ideas from the main framework
- Sketch out future tools, platforms, and interfaces
- May form the basis of future standalone modules or projects
- **Showcase recent enhancements** such as:
  - Adaptive feedback and dynamic field control (see nuclear containment v2 roadmap)
  - Gradient-aware and hierarchical containment architectures
  - Predictive, noise-resilient, and multi-channel energy management strategies
  - Modular, extensible simulation frameworks for rapid prototyping

## üöß What This Folder Is For

This folder is intended to:
- Provide **a home for in-progress, applied ideas**
- Let others explore, comment on, or even build upon these ideas with transparency
- Give me the room to move forward confidently without worrying about idea appropriation
- **Serve as a living incubator** for concepts I may continue developing, but also as a resource for others to draw inspiration from or implement independently

Many of these ideas are still evolving ‚Äî and this is a way to open them up to **dialogue, exploration, and future development**, without locking them into premature implementation or hiding them behind closed doors.

## üõ°Ô∏è Licensing

This folder has a different license than the rest of the repository.  
It‚Äôs designed to:
- Protect the **integrity and intent** of these designs
- Allow for **open conversation and copyleft-friendly development**
- Prevent misuse or premature reimplementation without consent

See [`LICENSE.md`](./LICENSE.md) in this folder for details.
