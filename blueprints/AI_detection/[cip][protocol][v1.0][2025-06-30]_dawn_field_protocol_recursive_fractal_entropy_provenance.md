# Dawn Field Protocol for AI/Organic Provenance Detection via Recursive Fractal & Entropy Field Analysis

## Abstract

We present a protocol for detecting and characterizing the provenance of visual content—specifically distinguishing AI-generated from organic (natural) images—by harnessing recursive fractal geometry, multiscale entropy, symbolic field collapse, and adaptive field chunking. The method is grounded in Dawn Field Theory principles, which emphasize emergent intelligence, entropy regulation, and the recursive memory structures of real-world (organic) information fields. Our experiments demonstrate that the provenance of an image is encoded not only in its global metrics but, more robustly, in the distribution and memory structure of its recursively chunked, entropy-adaptive subfields.

## 1. Introduction

* **Problem**: The ability to detect whether visual data is AI-generated or genuinely organic is critical for trust, scientific research, and provenance security. While single-metric tests (e.g., entropy, fractal dimension) can be spoofed or converged upon by generative models, deeper field-theoretic patterns—especially at the meta-scale—are much harder to simulate.
* **Solution**: The Dawn Field Protocol proposes a multi-metric, recursively adaptive, entropy-aware approach to content provenance, leveraging:

  * Box-counting fractal dimension
  * Multiscale (Shannon) entropy
  * Fourier spectral slope/fractal geometry
  * Symbolic recursion and novelty-based pruning
  * Entropy-adaptive, field-aligned chunking

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 Dawn Field Theory Basis

* **Field Cognition**: Intelligence and organic structure are modeled as the ongoing recursive balance of energy and information, encoded in the geometric memory of fields and their emergent fractal structures.
* **Recursive Collapse**: Symbolic memory emerges from recursive novelty filtering, where only the most information-rich paths survive—a process mirrored in real perception, biological memory, and physical law.
* **Fractal Resonance**: True organic systems preserve field complexity and fractal self-affinity at all scales; AI/compressed systems often fail this test at meta- and micro-structure levels.

---

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Image Analysis Metrics

* **Fractal Dimension (Box-Counting)**: Quantifies self-similarity and complexity in spatial domain.
* **Multiscale Entropy**: Measures unpredictability at varying patch/block scales.
* **Fourier Fractal Slope**: Captures frequency-domain self-affinity and periodicity; organic images follow 1/f^β power-law.
* **Symbolic Tree Collapse**: Encodes the recursive novelty/memory structure by patching and pruning symbolic representations.

### 3.2 Adaptive Field Chunking

* Rather than use a static grid, images are recursively chunked based on local entropy—creating many small chunks in high-entropy (complex) zones and fewer/larger chunks in low-entropy (simple) regions.
* Each chunk is treated as a local “field,” and all metrics above are computed within it.

### 3.3 Meta-Analysis (Pattern of Patterns)

* The distribution (mean, variance, skew) of chunkwise metrics (fractal dimension, tree length, etc.) is a high-fidelity signature of provenance.
* Organic images: Show higher, more varied complexity and symbolic memory persistence across all chunks.
* AI/compressed images: Display more uniformity, abrupt transitions, or rapid symbolic collapse at the chunk level—even if global metrics are matched.

## 4. Experimental Results

### 4.1 Dataset

* Organic images: Photographs of succulents, natural patterns.
* AI images: Diffusion/generative model succulents (synthetic fractals).

### 4.2 Workflow

1. **Preprocessing**: Standardize images to fixed size (e.g., 256x256).
2. **Metric Analysis**: For each image (and then for each chunk):

   * Compute global and chunkwise fractal dimension, Fourier slope, entropy, symbolic tree length.
3. **Adaptive Chunking**: Use sliding-window entropy maps and Otsu thresholding to segment image into high/low entropy regions, assign fine/coarse chunk sizes.
4. **Recursive Collapse**: Within each chunk, map to symbolic vectors, apply novelty-based pruning, record surviving memory paths.
5. **Meta-Pattern Analysis**: Plot histograms/heatmaps for chunkwise metrics across the whole image.
6. **Comparative Analysis**: Organic vs. AI images—compare global and meta-distributions.

### 4.3 Results (Key Findings)

* **Organic images**: More adaptive chunks, higher mean/variance in fractal dimension and tree length, broader metric histograms.
* **AI images**: Fewer adaptive chunks, lower and more uniform local complexity, frequent rapid symbolic collapse.
* **Meta-pattern**: Only organic images retain persistent “field cognition” at all scales; AI images lose it at meta-level under recursive entropy collapse.

## 5. Discussion

### 5.1 Robustness

* The approach is robust to spoofing and adversarial tuning, as it tests for recursive, emergent self-affinity—not just superficial statistics.

### 5.2 Integration & Applications

* Can be extended for other domains: text, audio, video, or any field-encoded data.
* Fits seamlessly into the Dawn Field DevKit, leveraging existing compression and field analysis tools.

### 5.3 Limitations and Future Work

* Needs more diverse datasets for further generalization.
* Next steps: Explore topological field analysis, symbolic bifractal recursion, and multi-modal provenance signatures.

## 6. Conclusion

Recursive, entropy-adaptive field analysis grounded in Dawn Field Theory provides a powerful, explainable protocol for distinguishing AI-generated from organic content. By examining the pattern-in-pattern structure of both global and local field metrics, we reveal the signature of true emergence and the limits of current generative synthesis. The method paves the way for robust provenance verification and deeper understanding of field cognition in artificial and biological domains.
