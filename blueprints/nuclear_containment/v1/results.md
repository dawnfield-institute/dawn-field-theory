# Nuclear Containment Report

## Objective

To evaluate the behavior of a simulated nuclear detonation under three containment conditions: uncontained, late containment, and pre-primed containment, using a field model based on Dawn Field Theory.

## Simulation Details

* **Domain**: 2 km × 2 km
* **Resolution**: 5 meters/cell
* **Timesteps**: 500
* **Initial Blast**: 50 m radius, temperature $10^7$ K
* **Threshold for Shock Radius**: 1,000 K

## Containment Modes

1. **Uncontained (Control)**

   * No containment field applied.
   * Simulates pure thermodynamic expansion.

2. **Late Containment**

   * Recursive Balance Field activated at timestep 250.
   * Attempts to reverse entropy expansion midway.

3. **Pre-Primed Containment**

   * RBF pre-initialized with a phase-pulse at timestep 250.
   * Designed to anticipate and invert the blast informatically.

## Results Summary

| Metric                    | Uncontained | Late Containment | Pre-Primed Containment |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------------- |
| Final Radius (km)         | \~1.6       | \~0.9            | \~0.1                  |
| Shockwave Radius          | Full domain | Partial arrest   | Contained              |
| Informatic Energy Gain    | None        | Moderate         | High                   |
| Stabilization Feedback    | N/A         | Delayed          | Immediate              |
| Entropic Collapse Success | ✗           | Partial          | ✓                      |

## Observations

* **Control Blast**: Diffused isotropically with full thermal bloom.
* **Late Containment**: Failed to fully reverse the entropy vector; partial energy conversion observed.
* **Pre-Primed**: Contained entropy within sub-100m region. Informatic structure developed radially.

## Metrics Plotted

* Thermal maps
* Blast radius over time
* Informatic field amplitude
* Field memory intensity
* Containment stabilization levels

## Conclusions

* **Containment is not scale-dependent**: Pre-priming allows high-energy events to stabilize early, despite resolution.
* **Late activation results in increased memory cost** and reduced effectiveness.
* **Informatic priming creates a structural substrate** able to resist and convert thermal entropy in real time.

## Recommendations

* Further refine sub-meter phase-locking
* Couple with entropy harvesting lattices
* Explore symmetry-based field nesting
* Optimize $\Phi$ structures for directional stabilization
