summary: >
  A high-yield 2D field collapse simulator with recursive nullification core, damping shell,
  and a reflective outer boundary layer. Designed to test spatial energy confinement strategies
  under extreme epistemic load. Models recursive collapse response, radial nullifier energy
  deployment, and echo-preventing perimeter reflection. Originally scoped from nuclear nullification theory
  under Dawn Field architecture.

parameters:
  grid_size: 150
  t_steps: 400
  containment_radius: 25
  initial_blast_amplitude: 50.0
  nullifier_gain: 3.5
  damping: 0.01
  noise_level: 0.01

outputs:
  - cumulative_energy_map: 2D heatmap of total energy across all time steps
  - field_dynamics: not shown in this version, future candidate for animation
  - energy_containment_integrity: qualitative stability indication based on leakage outside containment ring

notes: |
  This module does not yet include energy replenishment logic or field fatigue response.
  Further work recommended on adaptive nullifier decay and 3D spatial extension.
