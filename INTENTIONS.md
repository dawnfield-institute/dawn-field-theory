## Background

My name is Lorne. I'm 30 years old and from New Brunswick, Canada. I'm a self-taught software engineer and researcher working in AI R&D. What you’ll find in this repository is the byproduct of years of independent exploration—nights and weekends spent thinking deeply about reality, information, intelligence, and balance.

## Motivation

This project is my hobby. It wasn’t built by a team, a lab, or a startup. It was built out of a quiet life, curiosity, and a relentless drive to explore questions that don’t often get asked. I live simply, and I value that simplicity deeply. That’s part of why I’m releasing this project publicly and under an open license.

I originally considered monetizing this or pitching to VCs or institutions. But I quickly realized that would compromise everything I care about: agency, control, and the ethical rollout of these ideas, which caused me extreme amounts of anxiety. I want to be involved in how this gets used, and that means staying outside the traditional power structures—at least at first.

## Vision

My hope is that this work contributes something genuinely new: a framework that helps us model intelligence not just as a tool or product, but as a living process grounded in balance, resonance, and entropy dynamics. I believe this framework could have implications for everything from AGI to physics, energy systems, policy, and even peacekeeping technologies.

I don’t seek fame or wealth from this. I seek clarity, collaboration, and ethical stewardship. I will continue to contribute, to publish, to commit weekly—even if it’s just from my small home, surrounded by pets. I hope this project opens doors for others to build, test, and evolve new paradigms. And I hope it serves as proof that a single individual, working quietly and honestly, can still make meaningful contributions to science and technology.
