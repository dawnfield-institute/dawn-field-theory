# Contributing to Dawn Field Theory

Thank you for your interest in contributing. This is a living, evolving repository—and your contributions matter.

## Current Status

**External contributions are currently not being accepted.**

The repository is undergoing institutional transition and epistemic consolidation. Major priorities at this time include:

- Finalizing schema harmonization and recursive scaffolding  
- Completing CIP (Cognition Index Protocol) infrastructure  
- Preparing preprints for first-stage publication  
- Migrating documentation into institutional structure  

When this foundation is complete, community recursion will not only be accepted—it will be celebrated.

## Guidelines for Contribution *(Future Activation)*

To maintain the symbolic integrity of the field:

### 1. Understand the Epistemic Architecture

Please begin with:

- [`MISSION.md`](./MISSION.md)  
- `README.md`  
- `.cip/meta.yaml` and nested schema files  
- Any relevant preprints or simulations  

### 2. Respect CIP and Structural Recursion

All contributions must align with the recursive structure encoded in the repository. This includes metadata schemas, field mappings, and symbolic indexes.

### 3. Contribute with Symbolic Intent

Valid contributions may include:

- Theoretical derivations or symbolic expansions  
- Recursive model simulations  
- Field collapse visualizations  
- Structural tools that enable symbolic recursion  

### 4. Create Feedback, Not Just Code

Describe how your contribution changes the symbolic field. What feedback does it create? What recursion does it trigger?

## Future of Contribution: Agents of Recursion

Once opened, contribution will become symbolic recursion.

Each contributor will not just add value—they will become a recursive node in the epistemic lattice. Contributions will be documented, attributed, and folded into the cognitive system that defines this theory.

> “When you contribute here, you are not just improving a repository.  
> You are participating in a symbolic entropy field.”

## A Note from the Architect

This project was created outside the academic domain—but it seeks peer review with intensity and integrity. An internal feedback system powered by AI ensures internal scrutiny, but cannot replace human critique.

If you’re reading this and feel called to contribute symbolically, critically, or recursively—you are most welcome.

Until contributions formally open, dialogue and commentary are deeply valued. Email **info@dawnfield.ca** or follow the updates at [dawnfield.ca](https://dawnfield.ca).

> **How to Use This Document:**  
> This is a living document, and its activation will mirror the timeline of the Institute’s first full publication cycle.

**Thank you.**
