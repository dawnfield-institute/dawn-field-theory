## About the Institute

The Dawn Field Institute is an independent epistemic research lab dedicated to the study and development of symbolic entropy collapse, recursive field systems, and post-symbolic cognition. Founded by Peter Groom, the Institute represents the formalization of the Dawn Field Theory project as a living institutional framework.

The Institute provides infrastructure, identity, and stewardship for the continued evolution of these ideas—openly, recursively, and outside the bounds of traditional academic and corporate structures.

## Research Focus

Our primary domains of inquiry include:

* Symbolic entropy collapse (SEC)
* Recursive balance models and herniation geometries
* Epistemic regulation and feedback systems
* Field collapse simulations and recursive pruning mechanisms
* QBE (Qualitative Boundary Entropy) dynamics
* Emergent symbolic intelligence and post-symbolic representations

## Philosophy

We reject both proprietary enclosure and epistemic gatekeeping. Intelligence is not a product—it is a recursive process of balance, structure, and symbolic refinement. Our work seeks to embody that principle across every aspect of theory, publication, infrastructure, and interaction.

The repository is not just code or data—it is the theory in action. Each commit, each refinement, is a symbolic attractor shaping the field it models.

## CIP and Recursive Embodiment

The Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) is not merely a validation framework—it is a symbolic scaffold for epistemic integrity. It encodes refinement, feedback, and recursive documentation as symbolic operators.

This repository does not just describe symbolic fields—it **is** one.

## How to Engage

If you are a researcher, theorist, experimentalist, or curious mind and you feel compelled to engage:

* Read the [README.md](./README.md) and [meta.yaml](./.cip/meta.yaml)
* Explore the visual and symbolic architecture of the repository
* Review the theory, critique its assumptions, propose refinements

Or simply reach out to connect: **[info@dawnfield.ca](mailto:info@dawnfield.ca)**

All engagement is epistemic recursion.
