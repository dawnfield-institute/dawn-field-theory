# 🧠 Cognition Index Protocol (CIP)

The Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) is the backbone of Dawn Field Theory’s machine-native, protocol-driven validation pipeline. It defines the schemas, metadata, and procedures for timestamped, reproducible, and auditable experiments across the codebase.

## 🚀 Recent Advances (2025)

- **Protocol-driven experiments**: All new experiments and models (see `test.py`, `blueprints/AI_detection/`) are now aligned with CIP for reproducibility and peer review.
- **Transparency and explainability**: CIP enables tracking of entropy, fractal dimension, and neuron activity, supporting explainable AI and blackbox mitigation.
- **Open science**: All protocols, code, and results are documented for collaborative auditing and extension.

## 🎯 Purpose

CIP ensures that every experiment, model, and result in Dawn Field Theory is:
- Timestamped and reproducible
- Machine- and human-readable
- Ready for open peer review and collaborative science
