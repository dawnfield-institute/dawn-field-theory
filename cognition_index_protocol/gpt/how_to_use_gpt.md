# 🧠 How to Use the DawnField GPT

The **DawnField GPT** is a custom AI assistant built specifically to help users explore and understand the [`dawn-field-theory`](https://github.com/lornecodes/dawn-field-theory) repository. It uses intelligent metadata (`repo.yaml`) to navigate the codebase like a researcher — not a search engine.

## 🚀 Try It Now

> [🧠 Launch DawnField GPT v0.1](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-685015554f1c8191b9a32d84a0c248df-dawnfieldframeworkrepogptv0-1)

This is the live GPT agent built to navigate and reason through this repository.

## ⚙️ What It Can Do

* ✅ Understand the structure of the repo using a semantic map (`repo.yaml`)
* ✅ Load only the relevant files based on your question
* ✅ Answer with grounded insights from real theory, code, and experiments
* ✅ Adapt its reasoning using context weight, semantic tags, and your query intent

## 👉 How It Works (Under the Hood)

1. **Reads the `repo.yaml` file** to understand the structure and meaning of each file
2. **Identifies relevant files** to your question based on semantic tags and metadata
3. **Loads only those files** via dynamic API calls
4. **Explains or reasons** based on what it ingested — with no guessing
5. *(Later phases will include validation testing via CIP, but that’s not enabled yet)*

## 🗣️ Example Questions to Ask the GPT

* “How does the QBE model regulate entropy in this system?”
* “What does the recursive tree experiment reveal about structural coherence?”
* “List the most important theory documents in this repo and summarize them.”
* “Which models are aligned with the principles in `infodynamics.md`?”
* “Walk me through the neural architecture of `entropy_monitor.py`.”
