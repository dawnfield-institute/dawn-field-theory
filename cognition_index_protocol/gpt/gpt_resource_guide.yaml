# DawnField GPT Resource Guide (v1.0)
#
# NOTE: This document serves as a staging area for upcoming CIP (Cognition Index Protocol) updates. It organizes and abstracts major theories, blueprints, devkit, and models, providing instructions and document paths for each. Future CIP releases will integrate and formalize this structure.

# This guide organizes the codebase by major theories and frameworks. For each theory, instructions are provided for how the GPT should use/cite the theory, and all related documents are listed. Roadmaps and todos are included as context, not as primary theory anchors.
