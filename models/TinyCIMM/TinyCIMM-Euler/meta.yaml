notes: |
  TinyCIMM-Euler represents a significant advancement in the TinyCIMM family,
  building upon TinyCIMM-Planck's foundation to tackle higher-order mathematical
  reasoning tasks. The model is specifically designed to handle complex mathematical
  patterns, with prime number prediction serving as the primary benchmark for
  evaluating its mathematical reasoning capabilities. This version introduces
  mathematical memory systems, complexity-aware adaptation, and enhanced pattern
  recognition for challenging mathematical sequences.
  
  Key Innovation: This model uses field-aware, pattern-centric metrics instead of
  traditional distance-based loss functions. The Quantum Balance Equation (QBE)
  measures field coherence and pattern structure growth, focusing on abstract
  mathematical reasoning rather than simple prediction accuracy.
