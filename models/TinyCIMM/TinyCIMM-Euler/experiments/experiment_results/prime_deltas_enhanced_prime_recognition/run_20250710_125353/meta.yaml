description: Prime delta recognition experimental run executed on July 10, 2025 at
  12:53:53. Contains comprehensive results from enhanced prime number gap prediction
  experiment using 10,000 training steps with field-theoretic neural dynamics. Includes
  complete SCBF interpretability metrics, visualization outputs, and experimental
  logs documenting breakthrough artificial mathematical intuition.
