description: Prime delta recognition experimental run executed on July 10, 2025 at
  11:06:20. Early morning experimental run testing enhanced prime number gap prediction
  with field-theoretic neural dynamics. Contains complete experimental artifacts including
  SCBF interpretability metrics, training logs, and visualization outputs from breakthrough
  prime pattern learning experiment.
