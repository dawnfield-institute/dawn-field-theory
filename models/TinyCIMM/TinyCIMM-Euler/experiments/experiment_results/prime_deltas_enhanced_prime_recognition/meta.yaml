description: BREAKTHROUGH EXPERIMENTS - Prime number delta sequence prediction using
  TinyCIMM-Euler. Represents first successful artificial learning of prime number
  gaps through field-theoretic neural dynamics. Contains multiple experimental runs
  with enhanced configuration for normalized 8-step sequence prediction and comprehensive
  SCBF interpretability tracking.
