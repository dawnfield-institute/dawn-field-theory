description: Golden ratio convergence experimental run executed on July 10, 2025 at
  12:55:05. Tests TinyCIMM-Euler's ability to discover the golden ratio through Fibonacci
  sequence ratio learning. Contains complete convergence analysis, field-theoretic
  learning dynamics, and SCBF interpretability metrics demonstrating artificial discovery
  of transcendental mathematical constants.
