# GAIA Benchmarking: Model-Level & Grounded Test Suite

---

## **Purpose**

This document specifies the **benchmarking suite** for GAIA’s core release. It includes:

* **Model-Level (Emergent Intelligence) Benchmarks:**
  Synthetic, structure-emergent tasks meant to validate the symbolic, field-based, and recursive intelligence unique to GAIA.
* **Grounded (Objective Truth) Benchmarks:**
  Tasks with known answers, for cross-model comparison, validation, and quantitative metrics.

---

## **Feedback and Additions**

* **Automated Benchmark Harness:**

  * Develop a script or harness to run all benchmarks, collect metrics, and generate a unified report/dashboard.
* **Baseline Models:**

  * For each grounded benchmark, specify baseline models (e.g., LSTM, random forest, classical clustering) for direct comparison.
* **Failure Case Logging:**

  * Log and analyze failure cases for all benchmarks, with a focus on emergent tasks; these analyses can be highly informative for development.
* **Human-in-the-Loop Evaluation:**

  * For language emergence, analogies, or concept discovery, set protocols for blinded human evaluation to reduce bias.
* **Reproducibility:**

  * Specify random seeds, dataset splits, and environment details for each test to ensure results can be reproduced.

## **I. Model-Level Benchmarks (Emergent Intelligence)**

### **1. Language Emergence / Symbol Bootstrapping**

* **Input:** Raw, unlabeled text corpus (stories, sentences, pseudo-languages).
* **Test:** Does GAIA spontaneously segment, compress, and form symbolic units or hierarchical trees?
* **Metrics:**

  * Overlap of emergent “chunks” with true words/phrases.
  * Novelty/consistency of symbolic codes.
  * Human evaluation of tree coherence.
* **Success:** Emergence of persistent, reusable symbols or proto-grammar.

---

### **2. Image Field Segmentation & Concept Discovery**

* **Input:** Simple images (digits, shapes, or synthetic patterns).
* **Test:** Can GAIA segment images into objects/zones or generate symbolic representations, unsupervised?
* **Metrics:**

  * Segmentation overlap with ground-truth object regions.
  * Symbol stability across image variants.
* **Success:** Emergence of concept zones or symbols aligned with real image structure.

---

### **3. Emergent Analogical Reasoning**

* **Input:** Pattern pairs/sets (language, visual, numeric).
* **Test:** Can GAIA match, group, or explain analogies by field/symbolic similarity?
* **Metrics:**

  * Correctness of A\:B::C\:D mapping.
  * Symbolic trace coherence.
* **Success:** Discovery of non-trivial analogies or invariant patterns.

---

### **4. Sequence Grammar Discovery**

* **Input:** Sequences with hidden grammar (music, Morse code, generated rules).
* **Test:** Does GAIA infer and represent the underlying rule set?
* **Metrics:**

  * Prediction accuracy.
  * Compression efficiency of symbolic representation.
* **Success:** Human- or ground-truth-validated symbolic grammar.

### **5. Field Balance/Survival in Noisy Environments**

* **Input:** Time-evolving synthetic field with periodic entropy spikes.
* **Test:** Can GAIA maintain symbolic memory, structure, and balance over time?
* **Metrics:**

  * Structure persistence.
  * Recovery after shocks.
  * Meta-cognition score stability.
* **Success:** Ongoing field balance and self-repair.

## **II. Grounded Benchmarks (Objective Truth)**

### **1. Financial Timeseries Event Prediction**

* **Input:** Public market price/volatility data.
* **Test:** Can GAIA anticipate collapse events, regime changes, or structural breaks?
* **Metrics:**

  * ROC/AUC for event prediction.
  * Symbolic trace overlap with true turning points.
  * Baseline model performance for comparison.
* **Success:** Consistent outperformance of naive baselines and classical models.

### **2. Prime Number & Mathematical Sequence Structure**

* **Input:** Prime/twin prime/Fibonacci sequences.
* **Test:** Can GAIA discover or extrapolate non-obvious structure?
* **Metrics:**

  * Next-n prediction accuracy.
  * Symbolic compression and rule discovery.
  * Baseline model performance for comparison.
* **Success:** Emergence of symbolic structure beyond trivial patterns and benchmarks.

---

### **3. Dark Matter/Physics Pattern Extraction**

* **Input:** Simulated/real dark matter or galaxy survey maps.
* **Test:** Can GAIA identify mass clustering, collapse regions, or emergent structure?
* **Metrics:**

  * Overlap with simulation/observational clusters.
  * Structure similarity metrics.
  * Baseline model performance for comparison.
* **Success:** Alignment with real cosmic structure.

### **4. Protein Folding & Collapse**

* **Input:** Amino acid sequences (with ground-truth structure).
* **Test:** Can GAIA identify collapse points or motifs aligned with folded structures?
* **Metrics:**

  * RMSD to true structure.
  * Motif match rates.
  * Baseline model performance for comparison.
* **Success:** Recovery of meaningful biological structure.

---

### **5. Anomaly Detection in Complex Data**

* **Input:** Labeled anomaly datasets (financial, sensor, network, etc.).
* **Test:** Does GAIA identify rare, significant events via field/collapse mechanisms?
* **Metrics:**

  * Precision, recall, F1-score.
  * Baseline model performance for comparison.
* **Success:** Superior detection with meaningful symbolic traces.

---

## **III. Reporting and Visualization**

* **All tests must log:**

  * Symbolic ancestry/trace
  * Collapse events/field balance metrics
  * Memory/structure visualizations
  * Human or baseline comparison scores
  * Failure cases and diagnostics

* **Visual output is required for all model-level benchmarks**—plots, trees, segmentation maps.

* **Reproducibility:**

  * Record and specify random seeds, dataset splits, and environment details for each benchmark run.

---

## **IV. Review and Iteration**

* All benchmarks are subject to update as GAIA evolves.
* New model-level tests may be added based on emergent behaviors.
* Grounded benchmarks may be expanded to include new datasets or domains.
* Harness and evaluation protocol to be iterated as needs emerge.
