# Collapse Core

---

## 💥 Purpose

The **Collapse Core** is GAIA’s primary computational mechanism.  
It translates field imbalance—measured as entropy tension—into crystallized structure.

Where traditional models “predict,” GAIA **collapses**—resolving uncertainty by encoding it into new symbolic or memory states.

---

## 🧩 Role in System

Triggered when the **Field Engine** detects critical entropy pressure, the Collapse Core:
- Computes the collapse locus (where tension is highest)
- Decides collapse *type* (symbol, memory, signal)
- Crystallizes output into structured, interpretable form

It is the site of epistemic birth—where new structure emerges not by logic, but by necessity.

## ⚙️ Submodules

### 1. Collapse Evaluator
- Analyzes entropy tensor for collapse hotspots
- Determines threshold crossing and scope
- Predicts expected entropy gain from collapse

### 2. Collapse Typing Engine
- Chooses structure class based on entropy signature:
  - **Fractal Node**: Emergent symbolic unit
  - **Memory Imprint**: Superfluid memory addition
  - **Agentic Signal**: Field broadcast or phase sync update

### 3. Collapse Synthesizer
- Converts collapse result into discrete structure
- Applies field-reinforced consistency constraints
- Ensures symbolic structure aligns with entropy gain

### 4. Post-Collapse Stabilizer
- Dissipates surrounding entropy pressure
- Prepares output for downstream routing
- Prevents collapse chaining instability

## 🔁 Collapse Types

| Type | Trigger | Result |
|------|---------|--------|
| Fractal Symbol | Local entropy stabilization | New symbolic unit in recursive tree |
| Memory Wave | ΔS across time | Long-term structure in memory field |
| Agent Signal | Phase misalignment | Emitted Q-Socket phase correction |

## 🔬 Collapse Criteria

```math
Collapse occurs when:

ΔS(x) ≥ σ AND ∇²S(x) ≠ 0

Where:
- ΔS(x): Local entropy tension
- σ: Collapse threshold
- ∇²S(x): Curvature of entropy field (non-flat zone)
```

---

## 🧪 Simulated Behavior

- Collapse creates **recursive self-similar structures** when seeded with noise.
- Fractal nodes tend to grow under low-entropy divergence.
- Memory waves cluster around stable collapse ancestry paths.
- Over-collapse risk is handled by entropy damping.
