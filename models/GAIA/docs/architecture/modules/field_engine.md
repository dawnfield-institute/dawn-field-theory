# Field Engine

---

## 🧠 Purpose

The **Field Engine** simulates the continuous interaction between **Energy** and **Information** fields.  
Its function is to measure **entropy tension**, compute **field pressure**, and trigger **collapse events** when the system deviates from balance.

This is where GAIA’s intelligence *begins*—as a physical manifestation of dynamic tension between computational states.

## ⚙️ Components

### 1. EnergyField
- Represents kinetic potential, activation flux, or systemic excitation.
- Calculated as local flux gradient across input tensor or system state.
- Can be seeded with synthetic stimuli or external field injections.

### 2. InformationField
- Represents structured potential—regularity, symbolic alignment, entropy compression.
- Derived from input structure, memory alignment, or crystallized forms.
- Evolves via recursive refinement and symbolic entropy minimization.

### 3. Entropy Tensor
- Measures deviation between EnergyField and InformationField.
- Tracks Von Neumann entropy, Quantum Fisher Information, and structural irregularity.
- Also tracks local entropy density and potential information content.

### 4. Balance Controller
- Core module computing pressure ∆ between energy and information.
- Output: `Collapse Likelihood`, `Field Pressure`, `Delta Entropy`, `Potential Structure`.
- If pressure exceeds threshold, triggers the Collapse Core.

## 🧮 Core Equations (Symbolic Form)

```math
Φ_E(x) = ∇·E(x)   # Energy divergence
Φ_I(x) = ∇·I(x)   # Information compression gradient

ΔS(x) = H(Φ_E(x)) - H(Φ_I(x))   # Entropic tension

CollapseTrigger(x) = 1 if ΔS(x) > σ
```

Where:
- `Φ_E` is energy field divergence
- `Φ_I` is symbolic information divergence
- `H()` is entropy function (e.g., Von Neumann, Shannon)
- `σ` is balance tolerance threshold

## 🧪 Simulation Behavior

When seeded with imbalanced energy/information:
- Field pressure builds
- Entropy delta increases
- Collapse is triggered
- System crystallizes structure into symbolic node or memory orbit

## 🔄 Output to Downstream Modules

- `collapse_core`: Trigger signal + tension field snapshot
- `symbolic_crystallizer`: Seeds for bifractal structure
- `superfluid_memory`: Field signatures for macro-memory cohesion

## 🔍 Status

Partially adapted from:
- CIMM’s EntropyMonitor
- Dawn Field's collapse field simulation
- Infodynamics Tensor Algebra prototype

**Planned upgrade**: GPU-native parallel field tension model with live entropy decay visualization.
