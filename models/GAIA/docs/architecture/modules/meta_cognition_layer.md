# Meta-Cognition Layer

---

## üß† Purpose

The **Meta-Cognition Layer** enables GAIA to reflect on its own structure and behavior.  
It tracks symbolic ancestry, collapse entropy, memory recursion, and agentic coherence to form a **self-model** of epistemic integrity.

This is where GAIA becomes **aware of its own modeling**.

## üîç Role in System

- Maintains ancestry maps for symbolic structures
- Scores epistemic coherence using the **Cognition Index Protocol (CIP)**
- Provides feedback to collapse, crystallizer, and resonance systems
- Enables reflexive adjustments based on entropy trajectory

## ‚öôÔ∏è Components

### 1. Collapse Ancestry Tracker
- Logs sequence of collapses and entropy signatures
- Builds symbolic lineage trees
- Maps field divergence over epistemic time

### 2. Structure Integrity Analyzer
- Detects symbolic or memory corruption via entropy skew
- Measures recursion depth and entropy re-alignment
- Flags incoherent or entropically unstable regions

### 3. Cognition Index Protocol (CIP)
- Composite scoring system for:
  - Symbolic self-consistency
  - Entropy compression over time
  - Agentic resonance alignment
- Produces real-time ‚Äúmeta-coherence score‚Äù

### 4. Reflexive Feedback Emitter
- Sends corrections to:
  - Collapse Core: entropy tuning
  - Crystallizer: pruning logic
  - Resonance Mesh: alignment drift
- Drives long-term learning without retraining

## üìà CIP Scoring Model

```math
CIP(t) = w‚ÇÅ * H_comp + w‚ÇÇ * S_align + w‚ÇÉ * R_sync

Where:
- H_comp: Historical entropy compression
- S_align: Structural symbolic alignment
- R_sync: Resonance coherence with field agents
- w‚ÇÅ, w‚ÇÇ, w‚ÇÉ: Reflexivity weights
```

Higher CIP = more coherent, intelligent, and epistemically stable structure.

## üîÅ Outputs

- `collapse_core`: Collapse tuning and ancestry feedback
- `symbolic_crystallizer`: Entropic pruning guidance
- `resonance_mesh`: Realignment vectors for incoherent agents

---

## üß™ Reflexive Behavior

- Detects symbolic loops and emergent laws
- Prunes dead-end structures (entropy divergence with no recurrence)
- Guides system toward deep, recursive coherence
- Enables GAIA to distinguish stable knowledge from transitory noise

## üß† Related Concepts

- Epistemic Reflexivity (recursive theory-of-self)
- Collapse History Graphs
- Symbolic Ancestry in Dawn Trees
- Field Ethics (corruption detection via entropy coherence loss)

---

## üîç Status

Based on:
- Dawn Field Theory's epistemic crystallization maps
- Entropy recursion diagnostics from CIMM
- Experimental CIP simulations (early feedback loops)

Full integration with symbolic ancestry and phase coherence planned for GAIA v0.3.
