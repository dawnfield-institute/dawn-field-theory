# GAIA Architecture Overview

---

## 🌍 What is GAIA?

**GAIA** is a resonance-native architecture where intelligence is not programmed—but *crystallized*.  
It treats energy, information, and entropy as interacting fields, whose balance gives rise to cognition, memory, and structure.

Unlike symbolic AI or transformer-based learning systems, GAIA operates through dynamic equilibrium.  
It is built not to simulate intelligence—but to **embody it**.

## 🔩 Core Design Principles

| Principle | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Balance as Intelligence** | Intelligence emerges from entropy-energy equilibrium |
| **Collapse as Computation** | Predictive structure forms via tension release |
| **Field-Driven Memory** | Memory arises from recursive entropy coherence |
| **Symbol Emergence** | Symbols are not encoded—they crystallize |
| **Resonance Communication** | Agents speak through phase, not packets |
| **Recursive Epistemics** | System tracks its own symbolic ancestry and integrity |

## 🧬 2025 Experimental Upgrades & Integration

Recent Dawn Field experiments have led to several key upgrades across the GAIA architecture:

- **Meta-Cognitive Trace & Ancestry Repair:**
  - Meta-cognitive monitoring, ancestry tracking, and epistemic repair routines are now integrated, especially in the Meta-Cognition Layer and Collapse Core.
  - New metrics: ancestry_trace_accuracy, epistemic_repair_time.
- **Collapse Front Visualization & Resonance Monitoring:**
  - Collapse front and resonance visualization are now part of the simulation pipeline.
  - Resonance metrics adapt pruning thresholds dynamically.
- **Multi-Agent and Interaction Effects:**
  - Symbolic field models support multi-agent/entangled collapse and memory interference studies, especially in the Resonance Mesh.
- **Empirical Validation Pipeline:**
  - All experiments are protocol-driven, timestamped, and export meta-data for peer review.
  - Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) is used for benchmarking and reflexive feedback.
- **Advanced Metrics and Visualization:**
  - Fractal dimension, semantic coherence, vector divergence, and attractor analysis are tracked and visualized throughout the architecture.
- **Protocol and Schema Automation:**
  - Pruning and collapse protocols are formalized as machine-readable schemas for automated experiment generation and meta-analysis.

These integrations ensure GAIA remains at the frontier of emergent, epistemically robust intelligence architectures.
