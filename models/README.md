# 🧠 Models Directory

Welcome to the **engine room** of Dawn Field Theory! ⚙️ This directory contains the full implementation of symbolic models, learning architectures, and simulation frameworks. It’s where theory meets execution and recursive cognition is put into practice.

## 📁 Contents

* `CIMM/` – 🧬 *Computational Intelligence Mesh Model* — a symbolic learning system designed for field-aligned cognition, recursive entropy modeling, and agent-based simulation.
* `GAIA/` – 🌐 *Generative Artificial Intelligence Architecture* — experimental intelligence framework focused on resonance alignment, epistemic fields, and superfluid memory systems.

## 🎯 Purpose

The `models/` directory bridges the abstract with the executable:

* 🧪 Implements symbolic recursion and entropy-aware learning
* 🧠 Powers simulations in emergent field intelligence
* 🧱 Builds the technical foundation for cognitive field engines

Whether you're investigating collapse logic or training symbolic agents, this directory houses the **live software infrastructure** of Dawn Field Theory. 🚀
