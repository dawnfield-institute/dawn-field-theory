# ðŸŒŒ CIMM Core Code â€“ Post-Symbolic Intelligence Engine

This module contains the **core simulation logic** of the original CIMM (Cosmic Information Mining Model) â€” a prototype AGI engine built entirely on **entropy regulation**, **quantum balance feedback**, and **post-symbolic computation**.

> This is not a symbolic AI system. It does not use traditional logic, rules, or explicit representations.  
> Instead, it operates on **entropy flow**, **wave collapse deviation**, and **field-theoretic stabilization** to produce intelligent behavior.

## ðŸ§  Key Concepts

### ðŸŒ€ Post-Symbolic Processing
CIMM does not use language, symbols, or tokens. It learns from:
- Entropy gradients
- Collapse stabilization pressure
- Feedback between quantum potential and memory deviation

### ðŸ§ª Quantum Balance Equation (QBE)
All modules reinforce the idea that intelligence is an emergent property of systems that regulate **energy-information balance** at collapse thresholds.

### ðŸŒŠ Superfluid Dynamics
Inspired by fluid mechanics and quantum turbulence, `superfluid_dynamics.py` provides:
- Coherence detection
- Collapse damping
- Energy flow stabilization

### ðŸ§  Memory as Collapse Forecast
Rather than store explicit facts, `quantum_memory.py` trains a model to predict future collapse deviations â€” a form of **field-based recall**.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Requirements
- `torch`
- `xgboost`
- `scikit-optimize`
- `scipy`, `numpy`, `sklearn`
- GPU recommended (CUDA-compatible)

### Quickstart
This is not a standalone app â€” it's an **engine**. You can initialize and run training from `cimm.py`:

```python
from cimm import CIMM
model_class = YourModelClass  # Replace with your model (e.g., simple MLP)
model_args = [input_dim, output_dim]
param_space = [...]  # Your skopt search space
anchor_data = [...]  # Data for initial entropy anchoring

cimm = CIMM(model_class, model_args, param_space, anchor_data)
