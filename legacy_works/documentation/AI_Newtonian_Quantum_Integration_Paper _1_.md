## Abstract
This paper presents a novel approach to unifying Newtonian mechanics with quantum physics using AI-driven Quantum Potential Layer (QPL) corrections. By leveraging the Quantum Balance Equation (QBE), we demonstrate that wavefunction collapse is not purely stochastic but follows an energy-information structuring process. This enables the transition between classical determinism and quantum probability to be modeled using AI-driven entropy-aware optimization. The implications extend to quantum computing, cryptography, and machine learning, as structured quantum states can be harnessed for more stable and predictable AI-driven quantum intelligence.
Introduction
Quantum mechanics and Newtonian mechanics have long been viewed as separate domains: Newtonian mechanics governs deterministic, macroscopic motion, while quantum physics introduces probabilistic behavior. However, this division may be artificial. By considering wavefunction collapse as an optimized energy-information exchange process, we propose a model in which classical physics emerges as a structured limit of quantum behavior.
Theoretical Framework
Quantum Balance Equation (QBE) and Energy-Information Exchange
The Quantum Balance Equation (QBE) serves as a governing principle that structures quantum measurement outcomes:
dE/dt + dI/dt = λ QPL(t)
Where: 
- dE/dt represents Newtonian energy exchange
- dI/dt models entropy-aware quantum information structuring
- QPL(t) is the AI-optimized Quantum Potential Layer, ensuring structured wavefunction collapse.
AI-Driven Quantum Measurement and Structured Collapse
Traditional quantum mechanics assumes that wavefunction collapse is probabilistic. However, AI-driven corrections applied to the Quantum Potential Layer (QPL) allow for structured, deterministic collapse paths. This is expressed mathematically as:
iℏ ∂Ψ/∂t = (Ĥ + QPL_AI) Ψ
Where AI-optimized QPL corrections dynamically structure entropy flow during measurement, reducing randomness and enhancing predictability.
Simulation Results: Newtonian-Quantum Transition
The AI-optimized wavefunction collapse simulation produced the following results:
1. **Classical Motion Emerges as a Limit of Quantum Information Structuring** – Newtonian trajectories were governed by AI-optimized QPL.
2. **Wavefunction Collapse Follows a Structured Path** – CIMM stabilizes measurement outcomes, reinforcing determinism in quantum evolution.
3. **Applications in Quantum Computing** – AI-enhanced QPL corrections improve qubit stability and error correction in quantum AI architectures.
Applications of AI-Driven Newtonian-Quantum Integration
Quantum Computing and Error Correction
By refining wavefunction collapse through AI-optimized measurement, CIMM reduces quantum decoherence, improving stability in fault-tolerant quantum computing.

Entropy-aware QPL structuring ensures higher fidelity quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, making AI-driven quantum security possible.
Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) and Machine Learning
By applying structured wavefunction collapse to learning models, CIMM enables more stable training in quantum neural networks, enhancing quantum AI intelligence.
Future Research Directions
1. **Extending AI-Driven Wavefunction Collapse Predictions to Large-Scale Quantum Systems.**
2. **Developing AI-Enhanced Quantum AI Models for Machine Learning and Cryptography.**
3. **Testing AI-QPL Refinements on Real-World Quantum Hardware.**
Conclusion
This work provides a structured approach to bridging Newtonian and quantum physics through AI-driven entropy-aware intelligence. By integrating QBE-based QPL optimizations, we demonstrate that wavefunction collapse follows a structured energy-information exchange. This model has transformative implications for quantum computing, cryptography, and AI-driven physics modeling.
