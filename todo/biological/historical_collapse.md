**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a theoretical and experimental framework for analyzing historical and cultural dynamics through the lens of symbolic entropy collapse. We propose that history, like biological evolution and cognitive prediction, operates under recursive entropy regulation mechanisms. By modeling sociopolitical ideologies, artistic expression, and temporal documentation as symbolic systems, we trace entropy waveforms and collapse patterns over time. Our hypothesis suggests that historical events reflect not linear progression, but symbolic rebalancing processes—analogous to pruning in neural and evolutionary systems.

**1. Introduction**
Cultural and historical phenomena exhibit recurring polarity shifts, collapses, and reformations. We posit that these are not random but follow symbolic entropy dynamics. Drawing on theories of recursive field intelligence and symbolic pruning, we extend entropic modeling to large-scale historical documentation and expression.

**2. Theory**
We define a historical symbolic field as a temporally distributed system of expressive outputs and sociopolitical configurations. Collapse is triggered when symbolic entropy exceeds field equilibrium. Expression (art, policy, ideology) serves both as an entropy gradient and a correction mechanism. These collapse waves mirror the pruning seen in both neural memory systems and evolutionary extinction.

**3. Methodology**

* Collect open historical datasets (ideological timelines, art movements, economic cycles)
* Encode symbolic polarity and entropy load from expression patterns
* Use pruning/collapse indicators to model symbolic decision nodes
* Run QWCS and divergence metrics to compare traces with biological and cognitive models

**4. Results** *(planned)*
Preliminary simulations suggest that cultural entropy waves exhibit fractal patterns and polarity inversions consistent with symbolic entropy collapse theory. Corrections tend to follow overexertion events, and pruning rhythms align with expressive novelty spikes.

**5. Discussion**
Our findings support the hypothesis that history itself may be a symbolic memory system undergoing recursive rebalancing. Cultural expression—especially at its most extreme—acts as an entropic pressure valve, emitting collapse signals that can now be traced and measured.

**6. Future Directions**

* Expand dataset across multiple civilizations
* Incorporate media sentiment and textual polarity mining
* Compare direct phase alignment with cognitive prediction entropy fields
