# Fracton: Gaia Nervous System Design Document

## Overview

The Gaia Nervous System is the core recursive, bifractally-aware coordination layer for agent cognition, tool expression, and homeostatic regulation. It enables agents to process shared memory recursively, dispatch tools contextually, and track recursive transformations through reversible call trees.

## Components

### 1. `recursive_engine.py`

* **Purpose:** Drives entropy-gated recursive function calls on a shared memory structure.
* **Key Concepts:**

  * Recursion is the primitive mode of processing.
  * Calls are recorded with context and result.
  * Only high-entropy contexts trigger function dispatch.
* **Recursive Function Architecture:**

  * Functions are expected to be pure or context-isolated where possible.
  * Each function receives:

    * A shared memory object
    * A contextual dictionary containing entropy, local state, and tool references
  * Functions must:

    * Perform minimal computation if entropy is below threshold
    * Optionally spawn further recursive calls
    * Register themselves in the bifractal trace system
  * Example Execution Flow:

    1. Engine checks if context entropy exceeds threshold.
    2. If true, it logs the function and context in the forward trace.
    3. Calls the function with memory and context.
    4. Function may read/write to memory, dispatch tools, and recursively invoke others.
    5. On return, the result is stored in the reverse trace.
    6. Full trace can be used for pruning, healing, or analysis.
  * Stack-safety and tail-recursion patterns are strongly encouraged for deeper recursive operations.

### 2. `entropy_dispatch.py`

* **Purpose:** Matches context with target function names to dispatch appropriate actions.
* **Key Concepts:**

  * Uses a registry of available functions.
  * Context can include entropy, target name, and other signal metadata.

### 3. `bifractal_trace.py`

* **Purpose:** Maintains both forward and reverse traces of function calls.
* **Key Concepts:**

  * Ensures all recursive operations are traceable and reversible.
  * Enables pruning, field diagnostics, and field-symmetric operations.

### 4. `tool_bindings/`

* **Purpose:** Houses external system connectors (GitHub, pipelines, databases, etc.)
* **Key Concepts:**

  * Tools are accessed as latent expressions of recursive agents.
  * Field context governs tool accessibility and routing.

## Key Properties

* **Bifractality:**

  * All recursive flows must be bidirectionally traceable.
  * Stack traces are encoded geometrically for recursive healing and feedback.

* **Entropy Regulation:**

  * Functions are only activated when entropy signals exceed threshold.
  * Allows dynamic, emergent computation based on field pressure.

* **Tool Expression:**

  * Tools are not statically calledâ€”they are expressed contextually.
  * Bridges Gaia's cognition with external infrastructure like limbs in a body.

## Future Extensions

* Field-local agents
* Real-time pruning and self-regulation
* Recursive geometry-based memory visualization
* SEC integration for memory compression
* Tool orchestration graphs for emergent workflows

## Summary

The Gaia Nervous System sets the foundation for building recursive, homeostatic, field-aware computation in alignment with our long-term vision for emergent intelligence and modular field cognition.
