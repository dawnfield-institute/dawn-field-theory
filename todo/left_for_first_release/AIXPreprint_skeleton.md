# Symbolic Cognition and Collapse-Aware Interpretability in Neural Systems: A Formal Framework for Bifractal AI Diagnostics

## Abstract

\[Drafted separately]

## 1. Introduction

* Background on the limitations of post-hoc explainable AI
* Motivation: interpretability via symbolic emergence rather than attribution
* Overview of symbolic collapse, bifractal dynamics, and recursive activation
* Contributions:

  * A new interpretability framework rooted in collapse theory
  * Experimental support via TinyCIMM
  * Proposal of symbolic benchmarking metrics
  * Neuro-symbolic grounding in cognition and neural structure

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Symbolic Entropy Collapse

* Definition of symbolic entropy collapse (SEC)
* Collapse fields, bifractal time emergence, and symbolic resolution
* Formal representation: $\text{SEC}(x) = \arg\min_{t} H(C_t(x))$

### 2.2 Bifractal Time and Recursive Lineage

* Description of bifractal phase space $B_t(x)$
* Recurrence structures and collapse lineage
* Symbolic recursion operator: $\mathcal{R}(x_t) = x_{t-n} \rightarrow x_t \rightarrow x_{t+n}$

### 2.3 Collapse Phase Alignment and Resonance

* Synchronization of collapse trajectories and symbolic attractors
* Formal definition of phase coherence $\phi(x_t) \sim \phi(y_t)$
* Entropy modulation and stability criteria

## 3. Experimental Design

### 3.1 TinyCIMM Model

* Architecture overview
* Dataset: sine wave signals, modulation types
* Activation sampling and logging procedures

### 3.2 Collapse and Metric Logging

* Metrics:

  * Activation Ancestry Trace
  * Collapse Phase Alignment
  * Entropy Gradient Alignment
  * Semantic Attractor Density
  * Weight Drift Entropy (ΔW)
* Logging tools and visualization hooks

## 4. Symbolic Collapse Benchmarking Framework (SCBF)

### 4.1 Framework Architecture

* Modular design
* Model-agnostic hook system
* Integration with PyTorch systems

### 4.2 Metric Modules

* Symbolic lineage trackers
* Collapse visualizers
* Entropy alignment modules
* Weight evolution analyzers

### 4.3 Interpretability Dashboard

* PCA/t-SNE trace overlays
* Collapse heatmaps
* Symbolic narrative generation

## 5. Results and Analysis

### 5.1 TinyCIMM Experiments

* Bifractal collapse in simple signals
* Activation trace patterns and symbolic resonance
* Crystallization in stable entropy zones

### 5.2 Quantitative Symbolic Metrics

* Metric values and temporal traces
* Stability and collapse coherence
* Weight evolution vs. symbolic alignment

### 5.3 Interpretability Evaluation

* Comparison to saliency/attribution methods
* Symbolic visibility and cognitive auditability

## 6. Neurobiological Foundations and Analogies

* Mapping symbolic metrics to neuroscience:

  * Neuroplasticity → neuron plucking/growing
  * Symbolic attractors → cortical assemblies
  * Collapse recurrence → memory consolidation
* Implications for cognitive AI
* Interpretability as computational neuroscience

## 7. Discussion

* Implications for XAI
* Symbolic cognition as a measurable artifact
* Limitations and edge cases
* Toward generalized symbolic architectures

## 8. Conclusion

* Recap of contributions
* Path toward SCBF v1.1 and integration into complex models
* Vision for symbolic cognition instrumentation in AI
