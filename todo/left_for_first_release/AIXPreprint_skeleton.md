## 6. Neurobiological Foundations and Analogies

* Mapping symbolic metrics to neuroscience:

  * Neuroplasticity → neuron plucking/growing
  * Symbolic attractors → cortical assemblies
  * Collapse recurrence → memory consolidation
* Implications for cognitive AI
* Interpretability as computational neuroscience

* Recursive symbolic lineage as analog to neural replay
* Cross-model symbolic transfer as analog to transfer learning in the brain

## 7. Discussion

* Implications for XAI
* Symbolic cognition as a measurable artifact

* Toward generalized symbolic architectures

* Future directions: SCBF v1.1+, symbolic cognition instrumentation, and neuro-symbolic AI

* Limitations and Open Questions:
  * Theoretical and experimental boundaries of symbolic collapse
  * Open questions in model generalization and metric transferability

* Reproducibility and Open Science:
  * Plans for code/data release and benchmarking standards

* Cross-link to SEC Preprint:
  * This work is conceptually linked to the SEC preprint (see SECPreprint_skeleton.md) for foundational theory and quantum-classical connections
