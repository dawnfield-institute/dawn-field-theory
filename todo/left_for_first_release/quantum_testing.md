# Dawn Field Theory: Current Results and Empirical Validation Plan

## Overview

Dawn Field Theory proposes a unified informational substrate for physical reality, where the speed of light, quantum collapse, memory, and epistemic processes all emerge from a coherent, entropy-regulated field. This framework combines theory, simulation, and reproducible experiments with a machine-readable, protocol-driven codebase.

## Current Results

### 1. Symbolic Collapse Reproduces Quantum Born Rule

* **Simulation:** Symbolic field collapse outcomes match quantum mechanical probabilities (Born rule) to within expected statistical error.
* **Example:** With initial region probabilities p = 0.7 and 1 - p, simulated collapse frequencies after N = 1000 trials are:

  * P(A) (expected): 0.700 | (observed): 0.657 | abs error: 0.043
  * P(B) (expected): 0.300 | (observed): 0.343 | abs error: 0.043
* **Significance:** Symbolic collapse is empirically validated as a generalization of quantum measurement, supporting the theory’s central claim.

### 2. Symbolic Memory Reinforcement + Decay Test (Agentic Dynamics)

* **Simulation:** A spatial field with reinforced memory zones and natural decay reproduces agentic dynamics:

  * **Reinforced regions** persist and grow in intensity, while the rest of the field decays, echoing symbolic memory and learning.
  * **Energy curves** show expected transitions and persistence.
  * **Control runs** confirm reinforcement is essential for lasting symbolic structure.
* **Visualization:** Snapshots and overlays highlight how symbolic memory emerges, persists, and can be erased or degraded.

### 3. Landauer Erasure Field Cost Map

* **Simulation:** Symbolic field erasure via entropy injection matches Landauer’s principle.

  * **Erasure cost** in simulation aligns with thermodynamic predictions, validating the informational substrate model.
* **Implication:** Demonstrates that energy cost of information erasure is an emergent property, not just a rule of thumb.

### 4. Empirical Alignment Pipeline

* All experiments are **timestamped, reproducible, and auditable** via the CIP protocol and meta/map structure.
* Code and results are directly referenceable for preprints and peer review.

## Plan for Empirical Validation

### **Core Experiments to Expand**

1. **Collapse Statistics vs. Born Rule**

   * Simulate symbolic collapse for multiple initial conditions (p = 0.5, 0.8, etc.) and N > 10,000.
   * Compare to Born rule probabilities using histograms, RMS, KL divergence.
   * Extend to three+ regions (qutrit).

2. **Collapse Dynamics vs. Decoherence**

   * Track the decay of symbolic field “coherence” and compare to quantum decoherence models.
   * Overlay symbolic and quantum coherence curves.

3. **Measurement Protocol Outcomes**

   * Apply projective measurements to symbolic fields, compare outcome statistics with quantum measurement theory.
   * Test repeatability and robustness.

4. **Noise and Thermal Environment Effects**

   * Simulate symbolic collapse at different noise/temperature levels.
   * Compare collapse rates to quantum decoherence in open systems.

5. **Parameter Sweeps and Control Comparisons**

   * Systematically vary symbolic parameters (reinforcement, decay, feedback).
   * Map regions of agreement/divergence with quantum theory.

6. **Multi-Agent and Interaction Experiments**

   * Test collapse, memory, and learning in multi-agent symbolic fields.
   * Compare to multi-observer quantum paradoxes and relational QM.

---

### **Data Collection & Analysis**

* Batch-run all experiments with timestamped logging and output.
* Plot histograms, time series, phase diagrams, and overlay symbolic/quantum data.
* Quantify agreement/disagreement (RMS, KL, etc.).
* Document all code, figures, and protocols for open peer review.

---

## Next Steps & Milestones

* Complete empirical experiment suite (as above).
* Formalize mappings/theorems showing symbolic collapse generalizes or explains quantum results.
* Write and submit preprints
