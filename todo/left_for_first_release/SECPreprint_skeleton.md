## Title: **Symbolic Entropy Collapse: Topological Dynamics, Recursive Harmonics, and Quantum Validation**

### **Abstract**

This paper presents a unified framework for symbolic entropy collapse as a foundational mechanism in both emergent computation and quantum decoherence. We propose and validate a recursive-symbolic model that merges entropy field theory, Hodge-theoretic projections, and π-harmonic resonance to explain symbolic constraint convergence and collapse. Experimental validations include direct simulations of quantum decay curves, symbolic field geometries, superfluid collapse dynamics, and biological entropy analysis. Symbolic cognition models (TinyCIMM-Euler, SCBF) further support symbolic collapse as an applied substrate for mathematical and cognitive tasks.
