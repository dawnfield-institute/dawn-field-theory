# MCP Server for dawn-field-theory: Detailed Design Document

## 1. Overview
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server will act as a unified, agentic interface for knowledge management, semantic search, and protocol enforcement (CIP and others) across the dawn-field-theory project. It will provide a modular, extensible, and secure API for both human and machine agents.

## 2. Objectives
- Expose semantic search as a robust API service.
- Enforce CIP and other protocols on all data transactions.
- Enable agentic workflows: validation, provenance, recursive actions, and more.
- Support integration with future protocols and projects.

## 3. Architecture
### 3.1. Core Components
- **API Layer**: REST/GraphQL endpoints for search, protocol actions, and agentic tasks.
- **Protocol Enforcement Middleware**: Validates and enforces CIP and other protocols on all requests/responses.
- **Semantic Search Service**: Adapter to existing semantic search logic, abstracted for future backends.
- **Agentic System**: Handles recursive workflows, provenance tracking, and agent-based logic.
- **Integration Layer**: Hooks and interfaces for new protocols and projects.
- **Auth/Security Layer**: Authentication, authorization, and audit logging.

### 3.2. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)
- **Data Storage**: File-based (YAML/Markdown), with optional DB integration
- **Search Backend**: Existing semantic search logic, with adapters
- **Protocol Plugins**: Modular Python/JS classes

## 4. API Design
### 4.1. Endpoints
- `POST /search` — Semantic search query
- `POST /protocol/validate` — Validate data against CIP/other protocols
- `POST /agentic/task` — Trigger agentic workflows (e.g., provenance, recursive search)
- `GET /status` — Server health and protocol status

### 4.2. Example Request Flow
1. Client submits a search/query.
2. Request passes through protocol enforcement (CIP, etc.).
3. Semantic search executes.
4. Agentic system processes results (e.g., provenance, recursive actions).
5. Response returned to client.

## 5. Protocol Enforcement
- **CIP**: All incoming/outgoing data validated for compliance.
- **Extensible**: New protocols can be added as plugins.
- **Middleware**: Protocol checks as part of request/response lifecycle.

## 6. Agentic System
- **Recursive Actions**: Support for recursive search, multi-step workflows.
- **Provenance Tracking**: Record and expose data lineage.
- **Custom Agents**: Pluggable agent logic for advanced tasks.

## 7. Extensibility
- **Plugin System**: Protocols and agentic behaviors as plugins.
- **Integration Hooks**: Easy addition of new projects/protocols.
- **Configurable**: YAML/JSON config for server and plugins.

## 8. Security & Governance

## 9. Implementation Plan

**8.1. Integration Scenarios**

### Example: Connecting External AI Tools (e.g., Claude Desktop)

External AI clients, such as Claude Desktop or other LLM-based tools, can be configured to interact directly with the MCP server via its API endpoints. This enables:

- Direct semantic search and knowledge retrieval from the dawn-field-theory infrastructure.
- Submission of new data, documents, or protocol actions, with automatic enforcement of CIP and other protocols.
- Agentic workflows (e.g., provenance tracking, recursive queries) triggered by external agents.
- Centralized governance, security, and audit logging for all external interactions.

#### Example Integration Flow
1. User configures Claude Desktop (or similar tool) to point to the MCP server's API endpoint (e.g., `POST /search`).
2. The tool sends a semantic search query or data submission.
3. The MCP server enforces protocol compliance, processes the request, and returns results or validation feedback.
4. All actions are logged and governed according to project policies.

#### Benefits
- Seamless, secure integration of external AI/LLM tools with project infrastructure.
- Consistent enforcement of data governance and provenance.
- Extensible to future tools and agentic systems.


**8.3. Agentic CIP Knowledge Testing Endpoint**

The MCP server will provide a dedicated endpoint for agentic CIP (Cognition Index Protocol) knowledge testing. This enables agents, users, or external tools to:

- Submit a knowledge test request specifying the topic or area to be tested.
- Receive a dynamically generated or selected question from the CIP validation set.
- Submit an answer to the question.
- Receive a scored response based on comparison to ground truth (using semantic similarity, rubric, or keyword matching).
- Optionally, define an acceptance threshold for passing the test (configurable per user or agent).

#### Advanced Features
- **Adaptive Question Difficulty:** The endpoint can adjust question difficulty based on agent performance, starting with basic questions and progressing to more complex ones as comprehension is demonstrated.
- **Dynamic Rubric Selection:** Scoring rubrics can be selected or weighted dynamically based on the context, topic, or agent profile, allowing for more nuanced and fair assessment.
- **Feedback and Hints:** After a failed attempt, the agent can request feedback or hints, such as highlighting missed concepts or suggesting relevant sections for re-ingestion.
- **Performance Analytics:** The system can expose analytics on agent performance, including comprehension trends, most-missed concepts, and improvement over time.

#### Example Workflow
1. Agent submits a request to `/cip/test` with the desired topic or file reference.
2. MCP server selects or generates a relevant question from `validation_questions.yaml`.
3. Agent submits an answer to the question.
4. MCP server compares the answer to `validation_answers.yaml` and returns a score.
5. If the score meets or exceeds the user-defined threshold, the agent is considered to have demonstrated sufficient comprehension; otherwise, further action (e.g., re-ingestion, retry, or requesting a hint/feedback) may be suggested.

#### Benefits
- Enables measurable, protocol-driven comprehension for agents and users.
- Supports reflexive improvement loops and transparent scoring.
- Integrates seamlessly with CIP architecture and provenance tracking.

The MCP server can be embedded within or extended to support other internal infrastructure projects, such as VM orchestration, automation frameworks, and service management. This approach enables:

- Centralized protocol enforcement and governance for all infrastructure components (e.g., VMs, automation agents, services).
- Unified API for internal services to register, authenticate, and interact with the knowledge base and protocols.
- Agentic workflows (e.g., automated compliance checks, provenance tracking, recursive orchestration) across infrastructure.
- Extensible plugin system for adding VM management, monitoring, or orchestration capabilities.

#### Example Integration Flow
1. VM or automation agent authenticates with the MCP server.
2. The agent submits status updates, requests, or data to the MCP API (e.g., for compliance validation or provenance logging).
3. The MCP server enforces protocol compliance, processes the request, and returns results or triggers agentic workflows.
4. All actions are logged and governed centrally.

#### Benefits
- Consistent governance and compliance across all infrastructure projects.
- Simplified integration and extensibility for new internal services.
- Centralized monitoring, provenance, and audit logging for infrastructure operations.
1. Define API contract and data models.
2. Scaffold server (FastAPI/Express).
3. Implement protocol enforcement middleware (CIP first).
4. Integrate semantic search backend.
5. Build agentic system (recursive/provenance logic).
6. Add plugin system for protocols/agents.
7. Implement security and audit logging.
8. Write documentation and usage examples.

## 10. Future Directions
- Integrate with external knowledge bases.
- Support for distributed/clustered deployments.
- Advanced agentic behaviors (learning, adaptation).
- UI dashboard for monitoring and management.
