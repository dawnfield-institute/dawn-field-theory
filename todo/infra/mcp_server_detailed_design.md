# MCP Server for dawn-field-theory: Detailed Design Document

## 1. Overview
The MCP (Model Context Protocol) server will act as a unified, agentic interface for knowledge management, semantic search, and protocol enforcement (CIP and others) across the dawn-field-theory project. It will provide a modular, extensible, and secure API for both human and machine agents.

## 2. Objectives
- Expose semantic search as a robust API service.
- Enforce CIP and other protocols on all data transactions.
- Enable agentic workflows: validation, provenance, recursive actions, and more.
- Support integration with future protocols and projects.

## 3. Architecture
### 3.1. Core Components
- **API Layer**: REST/GraphQL endpoints for search, protocol actions, and agentic tasks.
- **Protocol Enforcement Middleware**: Validates and enforces CIP and other protocols on all requests/responses.
- **Semantic Search Service**: Adapter to existing semantic search logic, abstracted for future backends.
- **Agentic System**: Handles recursive workflows, provenance tracking, and agent-based logic.
- **Integration Layer**: Hooks and interfaces for new protocols and projects.
- **Auth/Security Layer**: Authentication, authorization, and audit logging.

### 3.2. Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python (FastAPI) or Node.js (Express)
- **Data Storage**: File-based (YAML/Markdown), with optional DB integration
- **Search Backend**: Existing semantic search logic, with adapters
- **Protocol Plugins**: Modular Python/JS classes

## 4. API Design
### 4.1. Endpoints
- `POST /search` — Semantic search query
- `POST /protocol/validate` — Validate data against CIP/other protocols
- `POST /agentic/task` — Trigger agentic workflows (e.g., provenance, recursive search)
- `GET /status` — Server health and protocol status

### 4.2. Example Request Flow
1. Client submits a search/query.
2. Request passes through protocol enforcement (CIP, etc.).
3. Semantic search executes.
4. Agentic system processes results (e.g., provenance, recursive actions).
5. Response returned to client.

## 5. Protocol Enforcement
- **CIP**: All incoming/outgoing data validated for compliance.
- **Extensible**: New protocols can be added as plugins.
- **Middleware**: Protocol checks as part of request/response lifecycle.

## 6. Agentic System
- **Recursive Actions**: Support for recursive search, multi-step workflows.
- **Provenance Tracking**: Record and expose data lineage.
- **Custom Agents**: Pluggable agent logic for advanced tasks.

## 7. Extensibility
- **Plugin System**: Protocols and agentic behaviors as plugins.
- **Integration Hooks**: Easy addition of new projects/protocols.
- **Configurable**: YAML/JSON config for server and plugins.

## 8. Security & Governance
- **Authentication**: API keys, OAuth, or similar.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control.
- **Audit Logging**: Track all actions and protocol checks.

## 9. Implementation Plan
1. Define API contract and data models.
2. Scaffold server (FastAPI/Express).
3. Implement protocol enforcement middleware (CIP first).
4. Integrate semantic search backend.
5. Build agentic system (recursive/provenance logic).
6. Add plugin system for protocols/agents.
7. Implement security and audit logging.
8. Write documentation and usage examples.

## 10. Future Directions
- Integrate with external knowledge bases.
- Support for distributed/clustered deployments.
- Advanced agentic behaviors (learning, adaptation).
- UI dashboard for monitoring and management.
