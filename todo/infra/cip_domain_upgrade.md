Title:
CIP Protocol Extensions: Contextual Permissions, Internal/External Routing, and Field-Aware Governance

Purpose:
This document proposes extending the Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) to manage project boundaries, enforce context-aware permissions, and automate content routing between public and internal repositories, ensuring clean scientific releases and robust IP security.

1. Motivation
As the GAIA project grows, we require explicit protocols to separate open-source science and model releases from proprietary infrastructure, tools, and research artifacts.

This avoids accidental leaks, confusion in publishing, and permission issues during collaboration or scaling.

2. Core Features
a. Role & Context Definitions
Roles:

owner, contributor, internal, external, reviewer, agent

Contexts:

public_release, internal_only, embargoed, experimental, user_private

b. Automated Content Routing
When new code, docs, or artifacts are generated, CIP context fields direct them:

Public → /public/, /docs/, or main repo

Internal → /internal/, .gitignored, or private repo

Embargoed → /embargoed/, with auto-release date for transition

c. Permission Labels & Enforcement
CIP fields at repo, directory, and file level declare permission context.

Tooling (scripts, assistants) must read context before generating, moving, or publishing content.

Example:

```yaml
cip_context: internal_only
permissions:
  - owner
  - internal
embargo: null
```

d. Audit & Movement Logging
Track when files move from internal to public, and who authorized.

Prevent unauthorized copying into public-facing docs or releases.

e. Automated Publishing Checks
Before generating a release or paper, scripts/assistants scan for mis-labeled or misplaced internal files, and flag errors.

3. Sample CIP Extension (YAML Block)
```yaml
cip_version: 2.1
context: internal_only  # or public_release, embargoed
permissions:
  - owner
  - internal
embargo:
  until: null  # or "2025-12-01"
audit_log:
  - moved_by: "alice"
    from: "internal/experiments/"
    to: "public/docs/"
    date: "2025-07-02"
routing_rules:
  - if context == "internal_only": move to ".gitignored"
  - if context == "public_release": move to "public/"
```

4. Proposed Workflow
- CIP context set when artifact is created (manual or automatic).
- All tools/assistants check CIP context before saving/moving/publishing.
- Release scripts audit context and block publication if conflicts exist.
- Audit trail maintained for all moves from internal → public.

5. Benefits
- Clear boundary between science (public) and infrastructure/IP (private).
- Fewer accidental leaks, better publishing discipline.
- Easier to scale up: contractors, agents, new team members all know what’s safe.
- Enables clean, trustable open releases while letting the internal stack evolve.

6. Additional Recommendations

a. **Schema Versioning**
   - Ensure all tools/scripts check `cip_version` for compatibility before acting on context or permissions.

b. **Integration with CI/CD**
   - Integrate context and permission checks into CI/CD pipelines (e.g., GitHub Actions) to enforce rules on every push, PR, or release.

c. **User Feedback**
   - When a publishing block or permission conflict is detected, scripts/assistants should provide clear, actionable feedback to the user or agent (e.g., "File X is labeled internal_only and cannot be published to public_release.").

d. **Documentation**
   - Maintain a central reference (e.g., `cip_contexts.md`) describing all valid contexts, roles, and permissions for easy onboarding and reference.

e. **Extensibility**
   - Design the schema to allow for future contexts (e.g., collaborator_embargo, sandbox) as project needs evolve.

7. Next Steps
- Draft initial CIP schema update and sample config files.
- Integrate context-checking into project tools/scripts.
- Review and update as internal needs or team/infra grows.
