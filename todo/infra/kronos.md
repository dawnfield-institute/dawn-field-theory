# üï∞Ô∏è Project Kronos: AI-Native Document Architecture

> **Tentative Name**: Fractal Document Object (FDO)
> **Project Codename**: **Project Kronos** ‚Äì named after the Greek Titan of Time, reflecting its core function: to embed **bifractal emergence**, **bidirectional temporal indexing**, and **recursive contextual awareness** into machine-readable documents. The goal is to transform passive documents into **active, self-indexing, semantically meaningful knowledge nodes** optimized for AI-native ingestion and interaction.

---

##  Motivation and Problem Statement

Contemporary documentation systems‚Äîwhether scientific papers, code READMEs, or research roadmaps‚Äîare designed for **linear human consumption** and lack any of the following capabilities:

* Explicit **semantic structure**
* **Bidirectional references** between ideas
* **Chunk-level reasoning units**
* **Cross-document emergence tracking**
* AI-optimized formats that enable **contextual retrieval, augmentation, and delta-aware learning**

CIP v1.0 provides a **forward discovery** system (`map.yaml`), but lacks support for recursive, fractal, and temporally-aware document representation.

**Project Kronos** aims to:

* Formalize a machine-readable format that aligns with your **bifractal emergence theory**
* Provide document systems that can recursively **load their context, ancestry, and influences**
* Enable real-time **AI cognition across document networks** using embeddings, semantic links, and relationship ontologies
* Enable even **single standalone documents** to become semantically expressive, dynamically explorable, and AI-native knowledge containers

---

##  Use Modes

FDO is not restricted to repositories or multi-document environments. It supports three usage tiers:

### 1. **Single-Document Mode**

* One `.fdo.yaml` file may describe a single standalone document.
* This document becomes **AI-interpretable**, **chunk-addressable**, and **semantically self-descriptive**.
* Ideal for whitepapers, essays, long-form notebooks, or scientific submissions.

### 2. **Project-Level Graph**

* A set of documents with shared context or theme.
* Each document has its own `.fdo.yaml` file, but they form a semantic web.
* This allows recursive loading of dependent or supporting ideas within a project.

### 3. **Repository-Level Architecture**

* A full-scale knowledge repository with `map.yaml`, CIP layers, and interconnected FDO documents.
* Used in research environments or large AI systems like Horizon.

Each of these use modes supports:

* Cross-referencing
* Embedding-enhanced reasoning
* Personalized AI interaction
* Idea lineage and revision tracking

> No matter the scale, FDO documents function as **AI-native knowledge units** that dynamically adapt to reader context, link across time, and expose ideas structurally.

---

##  Design Goals

1. **Temporal Bifractal Indexing** ‚Äì Documents must encode both forward and backward semantic references.
2. **Chunk-Level Atomization** ‚Äì All documents must be decomposable into addressable, embedded semantic units ("chunks").
3. **Typed Relationship Graph** ‚Äì All semantic connections between ideas must be explicit, typed, and queryable.
4. **Cross-Document Resolution** ‚Äì Chunks may reference other chunks across documents, enabling trans-document cognition.
5. **Delta and Provenance Awareness** ‚Äì Chunks and ideas must log their source, delta-resolution logic, and lineage.
6. **Embedding-Native** ‚Äì Semantic vectors should be first-class citizens for each chunk and document.
7. **Self-Guided Cognitive Loading** ‚Äì Documents must recursively expose all necessary contextual dependencies upon query.
8. **Support for AI-Native Presentation** ‚Äì FDO should allow AIs to dynamically reframe, restructure, or summarize content based on user queries, learning state, or needs.

### Components

| Component                     | Description                                                                                                        | Implementation Notes                                                          | Flush-Out Tasks                                                               |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **FDO Document Format**       | YAML-based semantic representation of document content, chunk structure, and relationships.                        | Should mirror but not replace canonical Markdown/PDFs. Stored in `.fdo.yaml`. | Formalize field types, schemas, nesting rules, and IDs.                       |
| **Chunks**                    | Atomic semantic units with `chunk_id`, `type`, `content`, `embedding`, and relational metadata.                    | ID system should support dot notation (e.g. `1.2.3`) for hierarchy.           | Define chunk typing system and metadata vocabulary. Implement chunk resolver. |
| **Relationship Graph**        | Defines how chunks relate across and within documents. Supports types like `refers_to`, `supports`, `contradicts`. | Must support forward and reverse relationships with `inverse: true`.          | Finalize ontology of relationship types, add weight/scoring system.           |
| **Backlink Indexing**         | Reverse index stored alongside forward relationships. Enables bifractal traceability.                              | Auto-generated from forward links during compile phase.                       | Build backreference compiler pass.                                            |
| **Cross-Document Linking**    | Enables ideas to connect to ideas in other FDOs.                                                                   | Uses `doc:` prefix to disambiguate foreign chunk references.                  | Define multi-doc resolution paths, preload behaviors.                         |
| **Embeddings**                | Semantic vector attached to chunks and/or documents.                                                               | Optionally stored inline, or referenced via vector index.                     | Choose embedding backend, normalize strategy, and test similarity search.     |
| **Recursive Context Loader**  | Dynamically loads all relevant chunks across docs when one is queried.                                             | Must avoid circular dependencies and prioritize relevance.                    | Design loader traversal algorithm, scoring heuristics, and chunk selection.   |
| **Delta Metadata**            | Captures which LLM or human authored a chunk, and how deltas were resolved.                                        | Enables revision tracking, audit logs, and refinement loops.                  | Finalize delta provenance fields and design validation format.                |
| **Knowledge Graph Generator** | Builds visual and machine-readable cognitive graphs of linked ideas.                                               | Supports export to DOT, JSON, or graph DB.                                    | Build prototype from sample `.fdo.yaml` corpus.                               |

##  Bifractal Temporal Logic Embedding

FDO supports **recursive bifractal emergence** by:

* Generating backlinks to all referenced content
* Preserving semantic lineage via `provenance`
* Tracking forward and reverse relationships across iterations
* Supporting version-aware context expansion

When queried, a chunk can:

* Resolve its ancestry (who cited me?)
* Load its progeny (who did I influence?)
* Provide timestamps and authorship across both paths
