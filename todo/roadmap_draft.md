## Dawn Field Framework â€” Post-Release Roadmap (v1.1+)

> This document outlines the structural, architectural, and methodological roadmap following the v1.0 public release of the Dawn Field Framework. It represents planned enhancements to CIP infrastructure, preparation for GAIA development, and formalization of documentation and agent interaction protocols. All deadlines are currently to be determined (TBD). The order of items listed here does not reflect any specific execution sequence; this is a planning document to organize next steps and parallel efforts.

---

### Pre-Release Preparation (Before v1.1 Activation)

To enable the post-release roadmap, several repository-wide tasks must be completed:

* Audit and update all README files and documentation to reflect current structure, content, and CIP compliance.
* Ensure consistency and completeness of all `meta.yaml` files.
* Perform a comprehensive restructuring of the repository to support modular design goals, including standardization of directory layout, naming conventions, and metadata alignment.
* Consolidate legacy content and experimental fragments in accordance with roadmap architecture.
* Finalize preparation of the repository and all core documentation in anticipation of publishing papers and opening v1.1 development.

### Strategic Infrastructure Development

#### CIP Upgrades

* Introduce explicit function-level interaction permissions:

  * `@cip.allow_modify`
  * `@cip.loggable`
  * `@cip.purpose`
* Modularize `.cip/instructions.yaml` to decouple permissions, metadata interpretation, and agentic behavior guidance.
* Extend and standardize naming conventions and tagging schemas within filenames and metadata.

#### CIP Version 3: Automation and Feedback Integration

* Automate metadata generation and validation (`meta.yaml`, `map.yaml`, etc.).
* Implement continuous integration pipelines to audit changes and generate compliance logs.
* Support recursive validation loops with agent-in-the-loop feedback.

#### CIP Protocol Sample Repository

* Create a dedicated public GitHub repository (`cip-protocol-template`) to act as a reference implementation.
* Repository contents:

  * Full `.cip/` directory with example `instructions.yaml`, `permissions.yaml`, `map.yaml`, and `meta.yaml`
  * Sample modules demonstrating CIP tagging in code
  * Simulated agent interactions and prompt examples
  * Validator scripts for CIP structure and compliance
* Intended uses:

  * Development and validation of CIP protocols and tools
  * Community template and onboarding toolkit
  * Ingestable utility layer for integration into the core Dawn Field repo

#### Agent Interaction Specification

* Establish `/agents/` directory with example prompts, interaction simulations, and test routines.
* Define agent usage standards and behavioral expectations under CIP constraints.
* Document canonical agent behaviors in relation to toolkits, simulations, and publication workflows.

#### CIP + GAIA Tooling Infrastructure

* Create `/tools/` directory housing reusable CIP and simulation-related scripts:

  * Linters, validators, schema generators, metadata compilers
* Facilitate shared utility development between Dawn Field and the CIP sample repository.

#### Roadmap Versioning and Maintenance

* Implement semantic versioning of roadmap documents (e.g., `core_roadmap_v1.1.0.md`).
* Track incremental progress and structural roadmap changes across development cycles.

### GAIA Project Preparation Modules

#### GAIA Bootloader

* Create `/gaia/` top-level directory.
* Define core GAIA lifecycle operations:

  * Initialization routines
  * Simulation ingestion pathways
  * Feedback capture and model adaptation logic

#### Modeling Toolkit Development

* Build a modular, reusable toolkit under `/toolkit/` or `/lib/inflow/`, informed by recurring experimental design patterns and modeling needs across the entire repository:

  * Entropy tracking utilities
  * Inflow and cross-relational dynamic modeling functions
  * Core `SEC` class implementation
* Organize the toolkit into logical submodules such as:

  * `infodynamics`: components derived from entropy modeling and inflow dynamics
  * `sec`: symbolic entropic collapse functions and primitives
  * `common`: general utilities emerging from experiment convergence

Document all tools with CIP-compliant annotations and embedded agent-use instructions to ensure clarity, reusability, and integration across experiments and modeling workflows.

#### XAI Framework Integration

* Introduce interpretability infrastructure into toolkit and simulation components:

  * Self-explanatory agents
  * Traceable decision logic paths
  * Feedback hooks and state auditing tools
* Define shared metrics schemas for entropy trends, symbolic density, pruning rates, and interpretability.

#### Publication Framework

* Formalize a structure for generating release-ready documentation and reproducible artifacts:

  * Standard directory layout under `/publications/[project]/`
  * Subfolders: `experiments/`, `docs/`, `dashboards/`, `tests/`, `metrics.yaml`
* Build publication runner scripts for exporting static or interactive artifacts.
* Integrate CIP tagging and compliance schema into all published materials.

---

### Modular Roadmap Infrastructure

#### Roadmap Directory System

* Create `/roadmaps/` to house versioned YAML or Markdown project roadmaps.
* Define schema for each roadmap item:

  * `status:` (e.g., planned, active, complete, blocked)
  * `dependencies:` (cross-links to other items or files)
  * `linked_files:` (explicit file references)
  * `cip_required:` (boolean for protocol governance)

#### Blueprint Dependency Mapping

* Embed dependency tracking metadata within blueprint notebooks.
* Use fields such as `depends_on:` and `linked_tools:` to formalize architectural linkages.
* Enable programmatic resolution of simulation requirements and prerequisites.

#### Release Checklist Development

* Create `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md` to standardize and validate release procedures:

  * Metadata file integrity
  * Consistency between README and core documents
  * CIP schema validation
  * Toolkit functionality and publication readiness

### Synchronization with To-Do Tasks

This roadmap links and coordinates with items already enumerated in the private `todolist.md` document:

* Final structure migration and cleanup
* Conversion and annotation of notebooks and devkit tools
* Symbolic fossilization and neural form interpretation
* Dashboard and simulation output standardization
* Expansion of CIP tagging and naming convention schema
* Benchmark and publication deliverables
* QSocket protocol design and blueprint modeling
