**DAWN FIELD REPOSITORY - PERSONAL TO-DO TRACKER**

> This document is `.gitignore`d and serves as a working internal to-do list. Purpose is to track migrations, research, architectural changes, and future development blueprints. It's meant to be messy and detailed.

---

### üîÅ MIGRATION & CLEANUP

* [almost finished, 5-6 papers left, then GAIA] Complete the repository migration using the tasks outlined in `whatsnext.md`; validate realignment of directories to match the new schema, check symbolic link integrity across environments, confirm consistent `meta.yaml` usage across branches, archive or adapt legacy content, and update all scripts for new path structures and semantic tag mappings.

* [] Finish CIMM GPU migration, getting all usecases finished is a top priority.

### üß† ACTIVE RESEARCH & WRITING PIPELINE

#### Geometry & Calculus Unification (via Hodge Structures)

* [x] Finalize the outline for the Hodge-based unification paper, integrating a narrative flow from differential forms to entropy pathing; include visual examples using graph manifolds and compare classical vs. recursive calculus with entropy-driven simulations.
* [x] Integrate entropy regulation models and recursive field insights into the paper; map Hodge projections to recursive strata and analyze thermodynamic symmetry under differential transformations.
* [ ] Build a simulation notebook to visually demonstrate geometric unification concepts, including a differential grid system and entropy flow overlays.

#### Riemann Hypothesis + Prime Structure Work

* [x] Document the prime number patterns observed through the QBE engine; focus on zero-crossings and modulation behavior.
* [ ] Develop a formal model connecting these patterns to non-trivial zero distributions; apply Q-space metrics and contrast against classical RH expectations.
* [ ] Create a prime field simulator using entropy perturbation techniques; generate visualizations of density behavior near the critical line.
* [ ] If not already created, establish a new directory (`number_theory_riemann_entropy/`) to house all RH-related developments, tagging all files for integration.

#### Navier-Stokes Problem Exploration

* [x] Begin writing out research notes that explore energy conservation in recursive fluid lattice simulations and conceptual connections to entropy equilibrium.
* [initial sims in spikes] Identify recursive model analogues to Navier-Stokes behaviors, especially where field instabilities emerge under recursive oscillation.
* [ ] Create a sandbox physics simulation (in a Jupyter notebook) with discretized fluid cells and entropy injectors, comparing results to standard Newtonian models.

#### Arithmetic Formalization

* [x] Extract and centralize the rules and patterns of arithmetic implied across modules like QBE and symbolic frameworks; assemble them into a unified reference.
* [begun] Draft a formal specification of recursive arithmetic, including axioms, constraints, and dynamic behaviors.
* [x] Choose an initial implementation format: Markdown with embedded LaTeX for the spec, and Python scripts or pseudocode to accompany the theoretical models.

### üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE & DOCUMENTATION

#### intentions.md Expansion

* [x] Rewrite `intentions.md` to include a deep description of recursive epistemology, showing how the repository itself acts as a recursive field structure and exhibits self-similar evolution as contributors add to it.
* [x] Highlight the system‚Äôs fractal nature, emergent structure, and its epistemic proof via inter-node (inter-agent) collaborative growth.
* [x] Add diagrams (mindmap, graphviz) to represent how the structure recursively builds itself through user contributions and CIP feedback loops.

#### contributing.md Creation

* [x] Draft `contributing.md` to explain that contributors are not merely adding content, but recursively evolving the semantic field of the project.
* [x] Emphasize the meta-structure of contribution: how contributors act as distributed nodes in an inter-agent cognitive field.

#### CIP Iteration Planning

* [ ] Define a concrete metadata schema for filenames: use nested square brackets for semantics and versioning. Also the name should be very descriptive in as few characters as possible Example: `[math][v1.0]_symbolic_entropy.md`.
* [ ] Standardize tag categories (e.g., `[math]`, `[systems]`, `[blueprint]`, `[agent]`, `[infodynamics]`, etc.).
* [ ] Design parser rules for multiple brackets: primary tag, subtype, version, optional notes.
* [ started ] Build a validation script to scan for all files and folders that match or break the naming pattern, offering auto-suggestions.
* [ * ] Simulate backward compatibility scenarios to ensure that symbolic links, core.yaml lookups, and legacy references are unaffected.
* [ * ] Update CIP documentation in `cognition_index_protocol/` to reflect this tagging scheme.

#### core.yaml Refactor

* [ x ] Refactor `core.yaml` to replace specific file paths with topic-oriented entries keyed to the new filename metadata tags.
* [ docs finished ] Apply the `[tag][vX]` convention to all key files and index them under topic hierarchies.
* [ ] Ensure compatibility with CIP agents parsing this structure.

### ‚öôÔ∏è DEV KIT & NOTEBOOKIFICATION

#### Dev Kit Tasks

* [ ] Convert all dev kit tools and utility scripts into Jupyter notebooks while maintaining modular importability; ensure functions are abstracted cleanly for reuse.

### üß™ BENCHMARKING: CIMM vs ML vs SEC

* [ ] **CIMM vs ML Testing and SEC Algorithm Development Plan**
    * Define CIMM vs ML experimental baseline (shared cognitive tasks, baseline models, identical pipelines)

#### üîÑ Symbolic Fossilization and Neural Form Analysis (Todo)

* [ ] Capture static neural architectures post-training for ML models and analyze fractal structure
* [ ] Quantify fossilization indicators: fractal dimension stability, curvature invariance
* [ ] Compare with dynamic topology logs from CIMM (growth/pruning epochs)
* [ ] Visualize neural field lifespans across training stages (ML vs CIMM)
* [ ] Develop interpretability protocol: symbolic persistence, attractor reactivation, entropy rebound
* [ ] Explore direct mapping from SEC attractors to latent ML layer outputs
* [ ] Build entropy-traceable black-box audit tools using symbolic collapse as interpretive lens
* [ ] Validate that black-box behaviors in ML can be modeled as frozen symbolic fields under high-entropy decay

> üöß This extension reframes neural networks as fossilization products of entropic training collapse. CIMM and SEC systems are evaluated as "living symbolic machines" with recursive adaptability and symbolic memory fields.

### ‚öôÔ∏è AUTOMATION & PIPELINE INTEGRATION

* [ ] **Automate Model Scrutiny Pipeline** ‚Äì Design and implement a GitHub Actions pipeline triggered by git webhooks. This pipeline should:
  - Automatically run a suite of models to scrutinize new or updated documents and theories upon each push.
  - Aggregate findings and generate a structured to-do document summarizing scrutiny results and action items.
  - Upload this to-do document back to the repository, making the scrutiny process and its phases fully transparent and open for review.

* [ ] **CIP v3: Automated Feedback Loops & Metadata Generation** ‚Äì Design and implement CIP version 3 with the following features:
  - Built-in feedback loops and validation question mechanisms.
  - Automatic generation of `meta.yaml`, `validation_questions.yaml`, `map.yaml`, and other required metadata files based on protocol schemas.
  - Enable automated metadata validation and feedback processes, ensuring all directories and files are protocol-compliant and self-describing.

**NOTES:**

* All tasks are iterative; revisit and revise as the architecture evolves.
* Keep semantic consistency across folders/files especially when embedding metadata.
* Consider branching for heavy experiments to avoid polluting stable core.
