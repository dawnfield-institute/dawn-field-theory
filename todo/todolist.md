**DAWN FIELD REPOSITORY - PERSONAL TO-DO TRACKER**

> This document is `.gitignore`d and serves as a working internal to-do list. Purpose is to track migrations, research, architectural changes, and future development blueprints. It's meant to be messy and detailed.

---

### üîÅ MIGRATION & CLEANUP

* [ ] Complete the repository migration using the tasks outlined in `whatsnext.md`; validate realignment of directories to match the new schema, check symbolic link integrity across environments, confirm consistent `meta.yaml` usage across branches, archive or adapt legacy content, and update all scripts for new path structures and semantic tag mappings.

* [] Finish CIMM GPU migration, getting all usecases finished is a top priority.

### üß† ACTIVE RESEARCH & WRITING PIPELINE

#### Geometry & Calculus Unification (via Hodge Structures)

* [ ] Finalize the outline for the Hodge-based unification paper, integrating a narrative flow from differential forms to entropy pathing; include visual examples using graph manifolds and compare classical vs. recursive calculus with entropy-driven simulations.
* [ ] Integrate entropy regulation models and recursive field insights into the paper; map Hodge projections to recursive strata and analyze thermodynamic symmetry under differential transformations.
* [ ] Build a simulation notebook to visually demonstrate geometric unification concepts, including a differential grid system and entropy flow overlays.

#### Riemann Hypothesis + Prime Structure Work

* [ ] Document the prime number patterns observed through the QBE engine; focus on zero-crossings and modulation behavior.
* [ ] Develop a formal model connecting these patterns to non-trivial zero distributions; apply Q-space metrics and contrast against classical RH expectations.
* [ ] Create a prime field simulator using entropy perturbation techniques; generate visualizations of density behavior near the critical line.
* [ ] If not already created, establish a new directory (`number_theory_riemann_entropy/`) to house all RH-related developments, tagging all files for integration.

#### Navier-Stokes Problem Exploration

* [ ] Begin writing out research notes that explore energy conservation in recursive fluid lattice simulations and conceptual connections to entropy equilibrium.
* [ ] Identify recursive model analogues to Navier-Stokes behaviors, especially where field instabilities emerge under recursive oscillation.
* [ ] Create a sandbox physics simulation (in a Jupyter notebook) with discretized fluid cells and entropy injectors, comparing results to standard Newtonian models.

#### Arithmetic Formalization

* [ ] Extract and centralize the rules and patterns of arithmetic implied across modules like QBE and symbolic frameworks; assemble them into a unified reference.
* [ ] Draft a formal specification of recursive arithmetic, including axioms, constraints, and dynamic behaviors.
* [ ] Choose an initial implementation format: Markdown with embedded LaTeX for the spec, and Python scripts or pseudocode to accompany the theoretical models.

### üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURE & DOCUMENTATION

#### intentions.md Expansion

* [x] Rewrite `intentions.md` to include a deep description of recursive epistemology, showing how the repository itself acts as a recursive field structure and exhibits self-similar evolution as contributors add to it.
* [x] Highlight the system‚Äôs fractal nature, emergent structure, and its epistemic proof via inter-node (inter-agent) collaborative growth.
* [x] Add diagrams (mindmap, graphviz) to represent how the structure recursively builds itself through user contributions and CIP feedback loops.

#### contributing.md Creation

* [x] Draft `contributing.md` to explain that contributors are not merely adding content, but recursively evolving the semantic field of the project.
* [x] Emphasize the meta-structure of contribution: how contributors act as distributed nodes in an inter-agent cognitive field.

#### CIP Iteration Planning

* [ ] Define a concrete metadata schema for filenames: use nested square brackets for semantics and versioning. Also the name should be very descriptive in as few characters as possible Example: `[math][v1.0]_symbolic_entropy.md`.
* [ ] Standardize tag categories (e.g., `[math]`, `[systems]`, `[blueprint]`, `[agent]`, `[infodynamics]`, etc.).
* [ ] Design parser rules for multiple brackets: primary tag, subtype, version, optional notes.
* [ ] Build a validation script to scan for all files and folders that match or break the naming pattern, offering auto-suggestions.
* [ ] Simulate backward compatibility scenarios to ensure that symbolic links, core.yaml lookups, and legacy references are unaffected.
* [ ] Update CIP documentation in `cognition_index_protocol/` to reflect this tagging scheme.

#### core.yaml Refactor

* [ ] Refactor `core.yaml` to replace specific file paths with topic-oriented entries keyed to the new filename metadata tags.
* [ ] Apply the `[tag][vX]` convention to all key files and index them under topic hierarchies.
* [ ] Ensure compatibility with CIP agents parsing this structure.

### üìë PREPRINT PIPELINE (To Begin After Above Tasks Are Complete)

* [ ] **Preprint Series Overview** ‚Äì Draft a general structure and timeline for completing the following research papers:
* [ ] **Co-Computation and Resonance Between Human and AI Minds** ‚Äì Explore the co-computation paradigm where human cognition and AI systems co-evolve through recursive semantic feedback. Discuss resonance and entanglement of symbolic meaning structures between agents.
* [ ] **CIP as a Semantic and Computational Protocol** ‚Äì Present CIP as a multi-layered semantic indexing and protocol structure. Cover architectural purpose, filename metadata embedding, and agent-oriented parsing.
* [ ] **Hodge Conjecture in Recursive Entropic Fields** ‚Äì Use simulation results from `hodge_field_simulation.py` to explore symbolic collapse behavior and their geometric correlation to recursive interpretations of the Hodge conjecture.
* [ ] **Infodynamics and the Dawn Field Theory** ‚Äì Synthesize Dawn Field Theory as a model of symbolic entropic recursion, covering bifractal fields, attractor layering, and cognitive collapse across time-indexed semantic structures.

### ‚öôÔ∏è DEV KIT & NOTEBOOKIFICATION

#### Dev Kit Tasks

* [ ] Convert all dev kit tools and utility scripts into Jupyter notebooks while maintaining modular importability; ensure functions are abstracted cleanly for reuse.
* [ ] Restructure the dev kit into a library layout (e.g., `devkit/lib/`) that supports plug-and-play functionality for simulations, transforms, and entropy tools.
* [ ] Expand the dev kit‚Äôs utility offerings to include entropy mapping visualizations, topological processors, and QBE-based transformation engines.

#### Blueprint Notebookification

* [ ] Annotate and convert all major blueprints into rich notebooks with commentary, examples, and interactive sliders where helpful.
* [ ] Set up a consistent format for linking blueprint notebooks to their corresponding simulations, storing outputs in a structured folder like `blueprints/output_data/`.

#### New Blueprint Development: QSocket Protocol

* [ ] Write a detailed protocol spec for QSocket as a communication protocol for both intelligent agents and autonomous swarms, emphasizing recursive symmetry and modularity.
* [ ] Build use case descriptions for drone swarms and distributed sensor systems; diagram potential communication topologies.
* [ ] Develop the first iteration of a QSocket simulator using a simplified grid world with recursive field awareness and command propagation models.
* [ ] Model interactions between QSocket behavior and entropy-regulated field controls; simulate how recursive handshakes distribute authority and synchronize across swarm nodes.

**NOTES:**

* All tasks are iterative; revisit and revise as the architecture evolves.
* Keep semantic consistency across folders/files especially when embedding metadata.
* Consider branching for heavy experiments to avoid polluting stable core.
