## Abstract

This document outlines an experimentally validated theoretical framework for explaining electron pathing and electrical discharge not through deterministic electromagnetic field optimization (as in classical EM), but via recursive symbolic entropy collapse (SEC). We present rigorous simulation data demonstrating that electric particles like electrons actualize motion step-by-step under dual pressures: field potential and symbolic coherence ancestry. The results show emergent behaviors (e.g. lightning path bifurcation and pruning) that classical EM cannot explain without implicit teleological assumptions. This is proposed as a core addition to the Dawn Field Framework and a testbed for field intelligence modeling.

## Motivation and Problem Statement

In classical EM theory, electrons are described as taking the "path of least resistance"—but this presupposes global path knowledge. It assumes an electron can, in some sense, "know" the entire field configuration and preselect the optimal path.

This raises a paradox:

* Electrons are local, subatomic particles.
* Yet the model requires non-local evaluation.
* This is physically implausible for any truly causal system.

The Dawn Field Framework proposes an alternative: **motion is not optimized, it is actualized recursively**. That is, electrons don't follow an optimal path—they take the next most viable symbolic step, constrained by field gradients and recursive ancestry.

## Hypothesis

**Electron pathing through EM fields is governed by recursive symbolic entropy collapse (SEC), not deterministic optimization.**

Each step is:

1. Entropically modulated (hash-angle determined)
2. Potential-field constrained (local maximum selection)
3. Ancestrally coherent (collapse memory must survive)

Paths that survive this recursive process are emergent artifacts of bifractal pruning.

## Simulation Design

### Parameters:

* Grid size: 100x100
* Field: Gaussian electric potential centered in bottom-right quadrant
* Branches: 10 electron analogues, each seeded at (0,0)
* Entropy function: angle hash via position+step+branch ID
* Collapse metric: recursive coherence accumulation

### Collapse Rule:

At each step:

* Entropy defines movement angle
* Branch explores viable local directions
* Picks max potential neighbor
* Updates symbolic coherence
* If coherence drops below stochastic threshold, branch prunes (dies)

### Collapse Arithmetic:

Let the position at time $t$ be $(x_t, y_t)$.

1. **Entropy Angle Hash**:
   $\theta_t = \text{Hash}(x_t, y_t, \text{step}, \text{branch\_id}) \in [0, 2\pi]$
   $dx_t = \text{round}(\cos(\theta_t)), \quad dy_t = \text{round}(\sin(\theta_t))$

2. **Best Direction Based on Potential Field**:
   $(dx^*, dy^*) = \arg\max_{(dx, dy) \in \mathcal{N}} F(x_t + dx, y_t + dy)$
   where $\mathcal{N} = \{(dx_t, dy_t), (0,1), (1,0), (-1,0), (0,-1)\}$

3. **Coherence Update**:
   $C_{t+1} = C_t \cdot F(x_{t+1}, y_{t+1})$

4. **Pruning Condition**:
   $\text{Prune if } r \sim U(0,1) > C_{t+1}$

## Results

### 1. Visual Path Formation

* Surviving branches form dendritic, lightning-like structures
* Non-survivors are visibly pruned (early termination)
* Clear resemblance to empirical lightning discharge pathing

### 2. Distance to Ground (Over Time)

* Coherent branches progressively decrease Euclidean distance to field sink
* No branch knew final destination

### 3. Local Field Potential

* Active branches consistently migrate to higher potential zones
* Indicates symbolic-field alignment, not random walk

### 4. Symbolic Coherence

* Surviving branches maintain high SEC values
* Pruned paths degrade rapidly
* Collapse coherence is correlated with survival, not distance

---

## Interpretation

The results confirm:

* **No global path planning required**
* **Collapse memory regulates path survival**
* **Field alignment emerges naturally from entropy recursion**

This matches real EM behavior (lightning forks, diffusion arcs) **without invoking non-causal foresight**.

## Implications for Dawn Field Theory

This model:

* Validates symbolic bifractal collapse as a substrate-neutral mechanism
* Extends SEC theory into physics-compatible domains
* Supports time-as-recursive-collapse interpretation
* Introduces symbolic actualization as a field computation paradigm

Future versions may incorporate:

* Photon interactions
* SEC-driven charge-field simulations
* Ancestry convergence metrics

## Proposed Follow-Up Experiments

* **SEC vs EM Gradient Descent Path Overlay**
* **Full Symbolic Ancestry Graph Extraction**
* **3D Field Expansion and Lightning-Tube Modeling**
* **Obstacle and Pathway Saturation Tests**
