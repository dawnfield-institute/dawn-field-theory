**Title:** Prime-Modulated Symbolic Collapse and the Hodge Conjecture

**Abstract:**
This paper explores a computational framework in which symbolic fields, modulated by prime-indexed angular harmonics, undergo entropy-reducing collapse to produce stable topological attractors. We propose that these attractors—referred to as symbolic cycles—may encode the structure of algebraic cycles in complex projective varieties, providing a novel computational analogy to the Hodge Conjecture. We present empirical results, discuss the theoretical mapping between symbolic and algebraic invariants, and outline a strategy for formalizing this correspondence.
