**Title:** Prime-Modulated Symbolic Collapse, Entropy Regulation, and the Hodge Conjecture

**Abstract:**
This paper introduces a computational framework in which symbolic fields—regulated by entropy constraints and modulated via prime-indexed angular harmonics—undergo entropy-reducing collapse to generate stable topological attractors. We propose that these attractors, which we term symbolic cycles, encode structures analogous to algebraic cycles in complex projective varieties. Through the integration of the Symbolic Entropy Collapse (SEC) mechanism, we demonstrate refined cycle isolation, increased stability, and greater theoretical clarity in our mapping to Hodge-theoretic invariants. This work advances a synthetic model connecting symbolic computation, entropy regulation, and cohomological geometry.
