# Mathematics & Arithmetic Roadmap

This roadmap covers the formalization and development of recursive mathematics, base transformation, and entropy reduction frameworks in Dawn Field Theory.

---

## Milestones
- Centralize rules and patterns of arithmetic
- Draft formal specification of recursive arithmetic
- Build base transformation engine and entropy metrics toolkit
- Develop invariance detection and logic embedding modules
- Prototype loss-based framework for mathematical constructs

---

## Current Priorities
- Finalize recursive arithmetic spec and implementation
- Build multi-base recursive evaluator and entropy analysis tools
- Document logic embedding and Euclidean loss metric experiments
- Apply base-recursive analysis to complex theorems and models

---

## Next Steps
- Extend symbolic theorem analysis and QBE integration
- Link results to cognitive compression and proof synthesis
- Publish reference papers and roadmap updates
