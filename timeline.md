## Phase 0: Pre-Release Genesis (2023–2024)
- Theoretical development in private research notebooks
- Early collapse geometry hypotheses and recursive balance formulations
- Initial simulation traces and entropy-bound modeling
- Field-based representations and schema sketches stabilized
- Entropy balancing model spike complete
- Predicting prime number structures, dark matter distribution and stock market trends without training

---

## Phase 1: Public Anchor (June 2025)
- Core documents and theory artifacts uploaded to public repository
- Infodynamics coined and defined as a post-symbolic process
- AGPL + natural law licensing established
- Structural folder scaffolding for simulations, devkit, and schema

---

## Phase 2: Simulation Emergence (July 2025)
- Formal Python simulation scripts migrated from internal spikes
- Collapse dynamics, recursive field oscillators, and energy-binding loops
- Data visualization prototypes and early interactive plotting
- Balance integrals and thermal trace dynamics codified

---

## Phase 3: Infodynamic Devkit (Q3 2025)
- Modular development tools for infodynamic systems
- Ontology-based schema tools and interface layers
- Plugin architecture for field-constrained AI systems
- Metadata versioning and archive traceability tools

---

## Phase 4: Model Genesis and Ingestion (Q4 2025)
- Initial training of balance-aware AI agent models
- Integration of collapse geometry into model feedback loops
- Experimental ingestion of simulations into active models
- Emergent testbeds for consciousness modeling and collapse heuristics

---

## Phase 5: External Collaboration + Publishing (2026+)
- Open research invitations and citation-ready documentation
- Longform papers for preprint and journal submission
- Symmetry analysis and natural law extensions
- Potential cross-institutional alliance formation
