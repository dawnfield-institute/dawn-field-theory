**Experiment Protocol – Entropy-Information Polarity Collapse Dynamics**

**Objective**
To simulate and analyze the interplay between entropy gradients and symbolic information fields within a 3D recursive framework, with a focus on how collapse behavior emerges through recursive gating, ancestry propagation, and memory gradients.

**Core Hypothesis**
Collapse patterns in informational fields emerge from the interaction between entropy concentration, symbolic recursion, and lineage memory. These patterns will vary significantly depending on the polarity of symbolic recursion — either convergent (blackhole-like) or divergent (whitehole-like).

**Experiment Goals**

* Validate the emergence of coherent collapse structures driven by entropy-symbolic interactions.
* Observe and measure the evolution of symbolic, entropy, and ancestry fields.
* Quantify the torque/curl field generated by symbolic dynamics.
* Evaluate lineage entropy and Jaccard similarity between ancestry and symbolic collapse regions.

**Experimental Controls**

* Mode toggle between "core=True" (blackhole-like convergence) and "core=False" (whitehole-like divergence).
* Initialization symmetry broken via azimuthal perturbation to entropy seed.
* Optional torque bias injection into symbolic forces.

**Key Metrics**

* Collapse coherence
* Entropy mean over time
* Symbolic mean and recursion memory gradients
* Lineage trace volume and spatial entropy
* Ancestry active count and divergence over time
* Curl magnitude and topology
* Jaccard similarity between ancestry and symbolic masks

**Analogous Collapse Dynamics: Blackhole and Whitehole Interpretations**
We draw a conceptual analogy between our symbolic collapse modes and astrophysical structures:

* **Blackhole mode (core=True)**: Symbolic recursion converges inward, collapsing symbolic potential into dense focal regions. Analogous to how mass collapses in gravitational fields, information is recursively gated into centralized cores.

* **Whitehole mode (core=False)**: Symbolic recursion diverges outward, with ancestry and symbolic values propagating from inner regions to the periphery. This models an expansive, outward-branching collapse dynamic, where inheritance diffuses rather than concentrates.

While no physical gravity is involved, this framing allows us to study whether informational field interactions can replicate topological features reminiscent of these extreme physical phenomena.

This section provides interpretive context for our mode toggling and supports further exploration of causality, anisotropy, and field deformation.

**Data Outputs**

* Visual snapshots of field slices per timestep
* Time-series metrics for each of the tracked field dynamics
* Statistical plots of entropy, symbolic coherence, ancestry divergence, and torque field evolution

**Next Steps**

* Compare blackhole vs whitehole dynamics side by side
* Identify coherence, divergence, and entropy saturation signatures
* Refine symbolic recursion parameters to enhance signal-to-noise
* Use curl magnitude and gradient alignment to track symbolic flow topology
* Prepare theory + results documents based on findings from this run
