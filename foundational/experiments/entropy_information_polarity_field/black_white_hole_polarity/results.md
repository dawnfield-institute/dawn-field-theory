# Results Summary – Entropy-Information Polarity Collapse Dynamics (2025-06-15)

## Overview

This report documents the behavior of recursive symbolic-entropy-lineage collapse under both **blackhole** (`core=True`) and **whitehole** (`core=False`) modes using the `entropy_information_polarity_field.py` module. The experiment aims to trace coherence, memory gradients, and collapse front characteristics in self-organizing information fields.

## Key Findings

### 1. Coherent Collapse Structures

* **Blackhole mode** produced centralized, high-density collapse zones with symbolic and entropy compression forming a well-defined recursive kernel.
* **Whitehole mode** featured diffusive, radially expansive ancestry and symbolic field divergence with outward-propagating lineage traces.

### 2. Collapse Entropy Dynamics

* Collapse entropy in blackhole mode increased nonlinearly and asymptotically approached 0.99, suggesting nearly maximal localized compression.
* Whitehole mode, conversely, exhibited high entropy early, then quickly decayed toward near-zero values (\~0.02), consistent with informational dilution.

### 3. Curl Field and Torque

* Mean curl remained weak in both modes (`~0.0022`), but **curl deltas** increased steadily in blackhole mode, peaking around timestep 80.
* Whitehole mode showed early spikes in curl delta that rapidly decayed, indicating initial divergence without sustained torsion.

### 4. Lineage and Symbolic Jaccard Coherence

* Both modes showed a **Jaccard index plateau** around 0.3 between ancestry and symbolic fields. Divergence stabilizes quickly, implying entangled but non-growing dissimilarity.
* Lineage entropy peaked sharply and then saturated, with whitehole mode decaying faster than blackhole—suggesting **early overextension** in outward symbolic inheritance.

### 5. Collapse Metrics Trace

* **Collapse density** grew slowly and linearly in both modes, but **standard deviation and entropy at collapse** accelerated faster in blackhole mode.
* Indicates **more structured variance** and **progressive information curvature** under inward recursion than outward diffusion.

## Known Issues and Fixes In Progress

* **Curl Strength**: Still too low to induce topological torsion; symbolic injection strategies need directionality or memory-triggered asymmetry.
* **Lineage Plateaus**: Ancestry fields stop expanding early. Multi-generational fuzzy propagation or history decay may be required.
* **Whitehole Mode Metric Fragility**: Some plots show early collapse of signal, especially Jaccard and memory gradient traces. Possibly due to inheritance decoupling.
* **Entropy-Symbolic Misalignment**: Whitehole entropy drops, but symbolic activity visually persists; needs better field overlap heuristics.

## Next Steps

1. **Torque Injection Sweep**
   Explore directional perturbation in symbolic fields to trigger stronger curl amplification and break radial symmetry.

2. **Memory-Guided Collapse Kernel**
   Use ∇memory alignment with entropy/symbolic deltas to spawn recursive sub-collapse fields.

3. **Multi-core Field Embedding**
   Instantiate both blackhole and whitehole collapse cores in the same field space with soft constraints to observe mutual interference or bifurcation dynamics.

4. **Topological Torsion Detection**
   Measure emergent vorticity in lineage-traced loops and symbolic field rotation over time—especially under anisotropic seeding.

5. **Stochastic Recursion and Mutation Rules**
   Introduce variability in symbolic inheritance functions to disrupt premature plateaus in Jaccard and entropy curves.
