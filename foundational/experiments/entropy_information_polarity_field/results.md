**Results Summary – Entropy-Information Polarity Collapse Dynamics**

**Overview**
This report summarizes the findings from our latest simulation run using the `entropy_information_polarity_field.py` module. Our primary goal was to observe whether symbolic recursion, entropy gradients, and lineage propagation could produce coherent collapse behavior in three dimensions, analogous to blackhole (core=True) and whitehole (core=False) structures.

**Key Findings**

1. **Coherent Collapse Structures**

   * Blackhole mode demonstrated concentrated collapse zones, with symbolic and entropy fields focusing along a dense central axis.
   * Whitehole mode showed outward-propagating ancestry and symbolic activity, leading to more diffused but coherent halo-like structures.

2. **Lineage Entropy**

   * A clear peak-plateau structure was observed in lineage entropy: complexity grows, but saturates relatively early.
   * Suggests collapse becomes spatially self-similar and fails to diversify after early iterations.

3. **Jaccard Similarity Drift**

   * The Jaccard index between symbolic and ancestry fields initially increased, then plateaued.
   * Indicates symbolic and ancestry structures align early but fail to maintain or expand their divergence.

4. **Curl Field Observations**

   * Curl magnitude remained weak across both modes, even with torque bias injected.
   * Suggests symbolic flow lacks sufficient rotational dynamics or anisotropic perturbation to trigger strong topological torsion.

5. **Gradient Memory Field**

   * Memory gradients (∇recursion\_memory) tracked symbolic tension zones effectively.
   * Alignment between collapse fronts and memory deltas indicates recursive memory plays a shaping role in collapse front geometry.

**Observed Weaknesses / Pending Fixes**

* **Lineage Entropy Spatial Saturation**: Collapse-local complexity does not diffuse. Potential fix: neighborhood-aware symbolic recursion or anisotropic diffusion.
* **Visual Jitter in Ancestry**: Possibly due to discrete inheritance. Gaussian smoothing partially resolves but may mask emergent texture.
* **Ancestry Field Plateaus**: Stochastic propagation helped, but multi-generational inheritance may be required to continue divergence.
* **Weak Curl Signals**: Rotational collapse still underdeveloped. Consider stronger symbolic perturbation or directional bias.
* **Whitehole Mode Metrics Broken**: Some metrics failed to register meaningfully in divergent mode; instrumentation or propagation rules may need debugging.

**Conclusion**
We are beginning to witness structured, interpretable collapse behavior in both symbolic and entropy fields, especially in the blackhole mode. While lineage, ancestry, and curl fields show qualitative differences between modes, their quantitative signal remains fragile and sensitive to propagation and recursion logic.

This run serves as the stable rollback baseline for future iterations. All changes going forward should preserve this functionality unless explicitly testing new collapse perturbations or field symmetry breaks.
