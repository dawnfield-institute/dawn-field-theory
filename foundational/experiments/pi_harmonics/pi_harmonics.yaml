summary: |
  This experiment demonstrates that angular modulation by the constant Pi stabilizes symbolic collapse
  fields, producing long-lived, coherent attractors with minimized entropy. A control using irrational
  angular bias (sqrt(2) * pi) fails to produce the same stability or structure, reinforcing the hypothesis
  that Pi acts as a recursive harmonic controller in symbolic emergence processes.
