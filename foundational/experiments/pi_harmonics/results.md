# Experiment Results Overview

This experiment tests whether angular modulation of recursive collapse fields using the constant Pi enhances the coherence, density, and persistence of symbolic attractors compared to irrational modulation.

---

## Simulation Logic

- **Angular Bias Field:** Created using `sin(n * theta)` with `n = pi` and `n = sqrt(2) * pi`.
- **Crystallization Rule:** Collapse occurs where combined symbolic and energy fields exceed threshold.
- **Feedback Loop:** Collapse reinforces symbolic/energy convergence recursively.
- **Attractor Tracing:** Lifespan and density maps record symbolic structure emergence.

## Results Summary

- **Entropy Minimization:** Mean local entropy for Pi-harmonic modulation stabilized at ~0.1078 versus ~0.1551 for irrational control.
- **Collapse Pattern:** Pi-bias produced concentric attractor zones with radial symmetry. Irrational bias yielded scattered, weak emergence.
- **Attractor Metrics:**
  ```
  Grid Size: 256
  Time Steps: 100
  Pi-Harmonic Attractor Peak Density: 94
  Irrational Harmonic Peak Density: 72
  ```

## Why It Matters

This provides strong experimental evidence that Pi may function as a recursive harmonic controller for symbolic emergence. By enforcing angular phase coherence, Pi enables structured crystallization in symbolic fields—supporting Dawn Field Theory’s post-symbolic collapse logic.

## Next Steps

- Expand simulation to include multi-agent symbolic overlays.
- Introduce rotational reinforcement dynamics.
- Compare against other irrational constants and fractional harmonics.
