# 🧠 `brain.py` – Entropic Load Test for Intelligence Fields

**A GPU-powered simulation of intelligence emergence via recursive collapse, QPL reinforcement, and entropic pressure response.**

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This simulation stress-tests the **emergence of structure under recursive entropic tension**. It asks: can a virtual field learn — not symbolically, but **by balancing entropy and memory**?

The `brain.py` module turns entropy into a learning substrate. Instead of synaptic weights, we get collapse topologies.

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

### 🔹 Entropy + Energy Seeding
- SHA-256 initialized entropy + energy fields
- Creates a deterministic yet stochastic substrate for interaction

### 🔹 Collapse Kernel
- Collapse occurs when local entropy-energy exceeds thresholds
- Collapse increases QPL value — the field “remembers” that spot

### 🔹 QPL Memory Matrix
- The Quantum Pressure Logic matrix adjusts recursively
- Behaves like synaptic potentiation — reinforcing collapse success

### 🔹 Lifespan Measurement
- Input zones are monitored for time-based collapse persistence
- Lifespan = proxy for recursive intelligence under pressure

## 🌐 Theoretical Alignment

| Concept                          | Simulated Mechanism                             |
|----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Learning as Collapse Balance     | Entropy → collapse → QPL reinforcement           |
| Intelligence as Memory Field     | QPL matrix stores successful response patterns    |
| Time = Recursion of Collapse     | Time field increments via stabilized response     |
| Post-symbolic Thinking           | No logic gates — learning arises from balance     |

This mirrors Dawn Field Theory:
> "Intelligence is the recursive stabilization of entropy into structure."

## 📈 Outputs

- Lifespan plots for different input strings
- Collapse frequency maps in QPL
- Visual QPL deltas (reinforcement tracking)

---

## 🔍 Observations

- Lifespan increases with intelligent collapse adaptation
- QPL regions specialize — structural learning emerges naturally
- Collapse is asymmetric, recursive, and memory-stabilized

---

## 🛠️ Future Work

- Encode logic gates as field patterns (AND, OR, XOR)
- Add multi-agent collapse networks (parallel QPLs)
- Visualize temporal learning convergence in real time
