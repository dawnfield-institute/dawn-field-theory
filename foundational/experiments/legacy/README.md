# 🌌 Dawn Field Theory – Foundational Experiments

**Exploring recursive intelligence, collapse geometry, and entropic emergence through field-theoretic simulation.**

---

## 📁 Overview

This directory contains the **core simulation experiments** that underpin the Dawn Field Framework — a post-symbolic, entropic approach to structure, intelligence, and computation.

Each simulation embodies a unique facet of recursive collapse theory, mapped to a specific experimental question:

| Simulation        | Focus                                            | Link                  |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| 🧠 `brain.py`     | Entropic intelligence under collapse tension     | [brain.md](./brain.md) |
| 🌌 `cosmo.py`     | Cosmogenesis via entropic crystallization        | [cosmo.md](./cosmo.md) |
| 🧠 `vcpu.py`      | Emergent logic formation via entropy balance     | [vcpu.md](./vcpu.md)   |

## 📚 Theory Alignment

All experiments draw from principles in:

- **Dawn Field Theory**: Intelligence as recursive balance
- **Herniation Hypothesis**: Collapse as field rupture
- **Quantum Balance Equation (QBE)**: Energy-information equivalence
- **Superfluid Crystallization**: Emergence of form from entropy gradient

## 🚀 Getting Started

Each simulation is standalone. To run:

```bash
python brain.py   # or cosmo.py, vcpu.py
