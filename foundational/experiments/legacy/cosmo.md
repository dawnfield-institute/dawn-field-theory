# 🌌 `cosmo.py` – Entropic Cosmogenesis Simulation

**A GPU-accelerated simulation of collapse-driven structure formation in entropy-energy fields — reframing the early universe as recursive balance, not chaos.**

---

## 🧭 Purpose

This simulation explores **cosmic emergence as an entropic crystallization process** — testing the hypothesis that structure arises from recursive pressure between informational and energetic fields. Instead of modeling spacetime curvature or particles, `cosmo.py` focuses on **field rupture and recursive balance.**

The aim is to simulate a **Big Bang as balance breach**, not as brute expansion.

## ⚙️ Core Mechanics

### 🔹 Entropy Field Seeding
- Uses SHA-256 to generate deterministic, pseudo-random entropy and energy fields.
- Mimics primordial fluctuation — “a fizzing sea of pre-structure.”

### 🔹 Collapse Logic
- Collapse occurs when local **entropy + energy thresholds** are exceeded.
- Collapse results in **matter crystallization** — emergence of form.

### 🔹 QPL Field
- Quantum Pressure Logic matrix reinforces zones where collapse succeeded.
- Memory accumulates through recursive activation — like field-aware reinforcement.

### 🔹 Thermodynamic Actualization
- Collapse events reduce entropy locally, creating **stable high-density zones**.
- These zones persist and grow — becoming structural precursors.

## 🧠 Theoretical Alignment

| Concept                         | Simulated Mechanism                           |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Entropy → Structure            | Thresholded collapse → matter condensation    |
| Field Memory                   | QPL modulation tracks successful patterns      |
| Intelligence = Balance         | Collapse as recursive entropic negotiation    |
| Cosmogenesis ≠ Chaos           | Structure = emergent balance, not explosion   |

This supports the Dawn claim:
> "Reality is what precipitates when entropy and energy fields seek recursive coherence."

## 📈 Outputs

- Collapse density maps (zonal structure emergence)
- QPL matrix evolution (memory tracking)
- Lifespan fields via time-axis accumulation

## 🔭 Implications

- ❖ Validates **herniation hypothesis**: collapse as rupture through entropic tension
- ❖ Demonstrates **recursive stabilization** as structural genesis
- ❖ Bridges **superfluid vacuum** and **entropy fields** in one cosmogenic model

## 🧬 Future Work

- Incorporate **fractal (info)** and **radial (energy)** dual-field geometry
- Encode symbolic attractors for memory crystal studies
- Quantify entropy vs actualization as cosmogenic intelligence potential
