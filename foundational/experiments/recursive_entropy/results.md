# Experiment Results Overview

This experiment tests how recursive tree structures can emerge from entropy-driven rules, with balance feedback and symbolic payloads. The simulation grows a tree by recursively splitting nodes, using entropy as a branching seed and pruning based on symbolic novelty. Each node is tagged with a semantic label and vectorized for later analysis.

---

## What the Script Does

- **Recursive Growth:** Nodes branch based on local entropy, with decay and balance resistance limiting depth.
- **Symbolic Embedding:** Each node receives a semantic tag (e.g., `entropy_84`, `structure_15`), which is also vectorized.
- **Adaptive Pruning:** Nodes with low novelty are removed, simulating cognitive filtration.
- **Thermodynamic Cost:** Each branch incurs a Landauer-like cost, mirroring physical computation bounds.

## Results Summary

- **Visual Output:** Two trees—one dense, pre-pruning; one filtered, post-pruning—showing the effect of entropy and pruning on structure.
- **Symbolic Trace:** Example chains demonstrate emergent reasoning paths.

## Why It Matters

- **Field Cognition:** Shows that recursive, entropy-driven rules can generate symbolic, memory-like geometry—supporting Dawn Field Theory's claim that intelligence can emerge from field imbalance.
- **Reproducibility:** The process is deterministic for a given seed and parameters.
- **Foundation for Further Work:** The structure can be analyzed for semantic coherence, memory pruning, and as a model for proto-cognitive field units.

## Next Steps

- Quantify semantic coherence and vector divergence across tree generations.
- Integrate symbolic attractors for higher-order cognition.
- Compare with other field-based emergence experiments.
