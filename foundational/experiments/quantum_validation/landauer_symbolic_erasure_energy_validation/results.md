# Landauer Symbolic Erasure Energy Validation

## Overview

This experiment evaluates whether symbolic entropy injection via stochastic bit-flips in a low-entropy symbolic field obeys the energy cost predicted by Landauer’s principle. The simulation introduces entropy into a stable symbolic field and computes the cumulative energy cost of erasure, using a thermodynamically inspired proxy.

## Methodology

* **Field Initialization**: A 1000-element symbolic field initialized entirely to symbol `'A'`.
* **Entropy Injection**: Each step flips a proportion of the field (flip rate = 0.05) to random symbols.
* **Energy Estimation**:

  * Per-step energy cost:
    $\Delta E = k_B \cdot T \cdot \ln(2) \cdot \Delta S$
  * Adaptive temperature scaling is applied based on the variance of prior entropy values.
* **Metrics Tracked**:

  * Shannon entropy over time.
  * Number of flips per step.
  * Adaptive temperature at each step.
  * Cumulative Landauer energy.

## Results

**Summary:** The experiment confirms that symbolic erasure respects the Landauer bound within a factor of 1.5, demonstrating physical consistency between symbolic entropy injection and thermodynamic limits.

| Metric                         | Value                    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Steps                          | 50                       |
| Final Entropy                  | 0.9913 bits              |
| Base Temperature               | 300 K                    |
| Theoretical Minimum Energy     | $2.85 \times 10^{-21}$ J |
| Measured Energy                | $4.27 \times 10^{-21}$ J |
| Ratio (Measured / Theoretical) | 1.50                     |

*The "Ratio (Measured / Theoretical)" row shows how close the measured cumulative energy is to the theoretical minimum. A value near 1 means the experiment closely matches the Landauer bound; values above 1 indicate the measured energy is above the minimum, as required by thermodynamics.*

* **Agreement**: The measured cumulative energy is \~1.5× the theoretical Landauer bound, indicating physical consistency with thermodynamic limits.
* **Entropy growth** and **adaptive temperature** behave as expected, reflecting realistic heat dissipation feedback.

* `energy_vs_entropy.png`: Cumulative energy vs. entropy.
* `adaptive_temperature_trace.png`: Temperature feedback curve.

## Interpretation

* The symbolic erasure process honors Landauer’s principle by not violating the minimum energy cost of bit erasure.
* Variability in adaptive temperature introduces realistic thermodynamic effects.
* Demonstrates that symbolic systems governed by entropy-aware logic can encode energy-cost principles emergently.

## Next Steps

* Explore entropy injection with higher-order alphabets and varying flip rates.
* Test with field structures reflecting memory or agentic reinforcement zones.
* Compare energy scaling under fixed vs. adaptive thermal conditions.
* Integrate this result into a broader symbolic thermodynamics suite for SEC.
