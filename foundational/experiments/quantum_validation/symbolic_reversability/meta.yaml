description: 'This folder contains the results and analysis of symbolic field reversibility
  experiments, including parameter sweeps, entropy and energy traces, and fidelity
  analysis. The work provides empirical validation for the Symbolic Entropy Collapse
  (SEC) framework and its thermodynamic implications for field theory.
