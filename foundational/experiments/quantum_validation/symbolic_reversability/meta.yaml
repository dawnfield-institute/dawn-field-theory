description: >
  This folder contains the results and analysis of symbolic field reversibility experiments, including parameter sweeps, entropy and energy traces, and fidelity analysis. The work provides empirical validation for the Symbolic Entropy Collapse (SEC) framework and its thermodynamic implications for field theory.
