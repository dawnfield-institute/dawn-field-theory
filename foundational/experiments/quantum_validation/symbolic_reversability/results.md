# Symbolic Field Reversibility and Hysteresis: Experimental Results

## Purpose
This experiment investigates how symbolic field dynamics respond to cycles of forward, reverse, and re-activation under varying dissipation (decay) rates. The aim is to determine whether symbolic entropy collapse mechanisms encode memory, path-dependence, and irreversibility, and to compare these results to quantum mechanical expectations.

## Methodology
- **Field size:** 100 units
- **Steps:** 150
- **Phases:**
  - Forward activation: 50 steps
  - Reverse (negation of signal): 50 steps
  - Re-activation: 50 steps
- **Input:** Sinusoidal pattern
- **Decay rates tested:** 0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.05
- **Metrics:**
  - Field state snapshots at steps 0, 49, 99, 149
  - Entropy trace (informational cost)
  - Field energy trace
  - Final state fidelity vs. initial state

## Results
For each decay rate, the following metrics were recorded:

### Decay Rate = 0.0
- **Fidelity:** 1.0 (no loss)
- **Entropy trace:** Returns to initial value after cycle
- **Energy trace:** Returns to initial value
- **Interpretation:** Field evolution is perfectly reversible; no memory or hysteresis observed. Matches quantum mechanical prediction for unitary evolution.

### Decay Rate = 0.01
- **Fidelity:** Slightly below 1.0 (minor loss)
- **Entropy trace:** Shows dissipation; does not return to initial value
- **Energy trace:** Shows dissipation
- **Interpretation:** Minor irreversibility and memory effects begin to appear.

### Decay Rate = 0.02
- **Fidelity:** ~0.97
- **Entropy trace:** Clear dissipation and hysteresis loop
- **Energy trace:** Clear dissipation and hysteresis loop
- **Interpretation:** Memory and path-dependence are encoded; field does not return to initial state. Symbolic hysteresis is present.

### Decay Rate = 0.05
- **Fidelity:** Lower than 0.97 (strong loss)
- **Entropy trace:** Strong dissipation; pronounced hysteresis
- **Energy trace:** Strong dissipation; pronounced hysteresis
- **Interpretation:** Significant irreversibility and memory effects. Field evolution diverges from quantum mechanical reversibility.

### Comparative Analysis
- As decay rate increases, fidelity loss, entropy dissipation, and hysteresis become more pronounced.
- Hysteresis loops (entropy vs. energy) are only present when decay > 0.
- The experiment demonstrates a tunable transition from reversible to irreversible symbolic field dynamics.

## Discussion
- The test shows that symbolic fields can encode history and memory when dissipation is present, supporting the SEC framework.
- The degree of irreversibility and hysteresis is controlled by the decay rate.
- Results diverge from quantum mechanical predictions when dissipation is introduced.

## Next Steps
- Sweep over additional decay rates and phase lengths
- Plot explicit hysteresis loops (entropy vs. energy)
- Test local reversibility with spatially varying decay or input gradients
- Integrate with memory attractor models for long-term symbolic memory
