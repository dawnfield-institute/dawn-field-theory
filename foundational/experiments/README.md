# ðŸ§ª Foundational Experiments

This directory contains simulation scripts and computational experiments that demonstrate and validate core concepts of Dawn Field Theory. Each experiment explores a different aspect of entropy, information, collapse dynamics, or field-based intelligence.

## Experiments Overview

### `DNA_repair/`
- **DNA_repairer.py**  
  Simulates entropy-based mutation detection and repair in protein sequences. Uses Shannon entropy profiles and a QBE-inspired scoring function to identify and correct mutations, visualizing entropy changes before and after repair.

### `recursive_tree/`
- **recursive_tree_entropy.py**  
  Demonstrates recursive intelligence emergence using entropy as a structural seed. Builds a symbolic tree structure where nodes branch based on entropy, with adaptive pruning to simulate memory and cognitive filtration.
- **recursive_tree_entropy_v1_1.py**  
  Enhanced version introducing thermodynamic realism, balance resistance, Landauer cost, and semantic vector embedding for symbolic tags.

### `superfluid_galaxy/`
- **proto_galactic_superfluid.py**  
  Simulates the emergence of galaxy-like macrostructures from purely informational field recursion. Models superfluid drift, recursive memory kernels, and entropy-driven clustering without invoking gravity.

### `symbolic_bifractal/`
- **symbolic_bifractal_expansion_v1.py**  
  Simulates symbolic bifractal recursion and collapse in a 3D field, validating the emergence of structure under semantic and entropic constraints.
- **symbolic_bifractal_expansion_v2.py**  
  Improved version with deeper recursion, higher fidelity, and lineage tracing. Includes validation artifacts and result visualizations.

### `legacy/`
- **brain.py**  
  Models entropic intelligence under collapse tension.
- **cosmo.py**  
  Explores cosmogenesis via entropic crystallization.
- **vcpu.py**  
  Simulates emergent logic formation via entropy balance.
- See [legacy/README.md](./legacy/README.md) for details.

## Purpose

These experiments serve as computational proofs-of-concept for the theoretical principles described in the Dawn Field Theory documentation. They are intended for researchers, students, and contributors interested in the practical and mathematical underpinnings of post-symbolic intelligence, entropy regulation, and emergent structure.

## How to Use

- Browse each subfolder for experiment-specific scripts and documentation.
- Run scripts as standalone Python files (see comments in each script for usage).
- Review visualizations and logs to understand the effects of entropy, mutation, repair, recursive growth, and field-based emergence.
