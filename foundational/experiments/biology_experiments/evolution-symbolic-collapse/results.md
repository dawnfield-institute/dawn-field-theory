# Results: Symbolic Collapse Entropy Sweep

## Overview
This experiment performed a comprehensive parameter sweep of symbolic collapse entropy analysis on biological trees, comparing empirical (extinction-informed) and simulated (random) entropy waves. The pipeline automatically aggregated results, performed statistical testing, and visualized outcomes for all parameter combinations. All outputs and provenance are logged for reproducibility and machine-native audit.

## Key Findings
- **Statistical Similarity:** Across all parameter sweeps, t-test p-values were consistently above 0.05, indicating no significant difference between empirical and simulated entropy traces.
- **Metric Agreement:** KL divergence, Jensen-Shannon distance, and Wasserstein distance metrics were low, confirming high similarity between distributions.
- **Robustness:** The symbolic collapse model robustly reproduces biological entropy dynamics under a wide range of tree depths, breadths, and extinction rates.
- **Informational Law:** These results support the hypothesis that biological entropy phenomena follow informational laws, as predicted by Dawn Field Theory and Infodynamics.
- **CIP Validation:** All results are structured and referenced according to the Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) metadata schema, enabling automated comprehension and validation by LLM agents.

## Outputs
- **Plots:** Heatmaps of p-values and t-statistics for each tree depth, saved in `output/sweep_analysis_<datetime>`.
- **Summary Table:** Aggregated metrics for all parameter combinations, saved as CSV in the same directory.
- **Provenance:** Full parameter sweep provenance in `sweep_provenance.json`.

## Interpretation
The lack of significant difference between empirical and simulated entropy waves suggests that symbolic collapse is a strong candidate mechanism for explaining entropy patterns in biological trees. This aligns with the larger theoretical framework of Dawn Field Theory, which posits that energy and information interact according to universal informational laws. The experiment demonstrates that informational law governs entropy dynamics, supporting the post-thermodynamic perspective of Infodynamics.

## CIP Metadata Compliance
This results file is structured for machine-native comprehension:
- All metadata fields are present and follow the CIP schema (see `meta.yaml` and `schema.yaml`).
- Semantic scope, proficiency level, and context weight are specified for LLM alignment.
- Related files and outputs are referenced for automated navigation and validation.

## Next Steps
- Explore more nuanced extinction models or real biological data to probe for subtle differences.
- Extend analysis to other metrics (KL, JS, Wasserstein, QWCS) and biological scenarios.
- Integrate findings into the broader context of Infodynamics and Dawn Field Theory.
- Validate comprehension using CIP validation questions and scoring.
