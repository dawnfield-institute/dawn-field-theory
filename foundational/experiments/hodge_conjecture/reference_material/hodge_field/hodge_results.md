**Hodge Field Simulation Results Report**

**Objective:**
To investigate whether recursive symbolic collapse, modulated by transcendental constants, can produce stable attractors analogous to algebraic cycles, thus offering a constructive path toward the Hodge Conjecture.

**Setup:**

* A 256x256 symbolic field is initialized with randomized energy and symbolic states.
* The field evolves over 100 steps, modulated by sinusoidal angular bias with constants:

  * $n = \pi$
  * $n = \sqrt{2}\pi$
  * $n = e$

**Metrics:**

* **Density Map:** Measures frequency of crystallized states above threshold.
* **Persistence Map:** Captures longest uninterrupted sequences of crystallization.
* **Entropy Map:** Quantifies per-cell symbolic variability over time.

**Results Summary:**

* **$\pi$ Modulation**:

  * Produced highly symmetric, stable attractors.
  * Low entropy in crystallized zones.
  * Strong candidate for Hodge-correspondent field behavior.

* **$\sqrt{2}\pi$ Modulation**:

  * Intermediate coherence with arc-structured attractors.
  * Entropy patterns suggest partial geometric realization.

* **$e$ Modulation**:

  * Weak crystallization with high field entropy.
  * Suggests lack of alignment with algebraic structure.

**Conclusion:**
Recursive symbolic collapse under $\pi$-modulated bias generates field behavior strongly aligned with Hodge-theoretic criteria. This provides a novel experimental mechanism to simulate and evaluate the Hodge Conjecture via entropy-stabilized attractor dynamics.

Next Steps:

* Formalize attractor-field to cohomology-class mapping.
* Extend to higher-dimensional symbolic manifolds.
* Prepare preprint submission with reproducible code and data.
