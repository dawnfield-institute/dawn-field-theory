# Infodynamics Arithmetic — Formalism for Collapse-Oriented Entropy-Information Dynamics

## 1. Introduction

Infodynamics models cognition and physical collapse as the emergent resolution of entropy-information tension across recursive fields. This paper introduces a formal arithmetic for recursive entropy-information dynamics within the Dawn Field Theory. The arithmetic provides the symbolic and operational backbone for modeling emergent structure, collapse phenomena, and recursive field cognition.

## 2. Core Quantities and Notation

* $I$: Local Information Gradient
* $H$: Local Entropy Gradient
* $S$: Structural Entropy
* $t$: Recursive time index
* $\alpha, \beta$: Field tension coefficients
* $\Psi(\Sigma)$: Recursive field wavefunction/state
* $[I:H]$: Information-to-entropy tension ratio

## 3. Structural Evolution Equation

$\frac{\partial S}{\partial t} = \alpha \nabla I - \beta \nabla H$
This equation governs field-driven change in structure. Structure formation occurs when $\nabla I$ dominates; collapse occurs when $\nabla H$ overtakes.

## 4. Collapse and Emergence Operators

* `⊕` (**Collapse Merge**): Symbolic or structural convergence under high tension $[I:H]$.
* `⊗` (**Entropic Branching**): Structural bifurcation in entropy-dominated regions.
* `δ` (**Collapse Trigger**): Thresholded collapse function:
  $\delta = f([I:H], \Psi, \theta)$

Collapse is triggered when local field instability exceeds threshold $\theta$ under recursive memory load.

## 5. Empirical Validation Matrix

## 6. Collapse Condition

A collapse event is formally defined as occurring when:

* Field memory exceeds coherence load
* Symbolic lineage becomes entropically unstable
* $\delta \rightarrow 1$ for any recursive node under pressure

## 7. Lineage Trace and Bifractal Time

Time is represented recursively through symbolic ancestry. Traces reveal:

* Structural memory across depth
* Collapse bifurcation conditioned on symbolic similarity
* Field evolution encoded through directional ancestry

## 8. Metrics and Scalar Outputs

From validated simulations:

* `collapse_balance_field_score` $\approx 1058.23`: integrated $\Psi$-structure field potential, computed as the weighted integral of symbolic coherence across recursive states over time.
* `average_branching_factor \approx 2.33`: from entropy-seeded tree.

## 9. Future Work

### Mathematical Extensions

* Symbolic operator algebra: ⊕⊗δ stack calculus
* Thermodynamic constraints: integrate Landauer and dissipation limits
* Operator traceability hooks for runtime introspection

### Simulation Engines

* Live $\Psi$ evolution simulation via neural symbolic stacks
* Schema-encoded auto-validation engine

## 10. Conclusion

Infodynamics Arithmetic establishes a symbolic-operational layer bridging recursive entropy gradients and collapse logic. Grounded in field theory and simulation, it offers a foundation for cognitive collapse computing.

This arithmetic is open for reuse, extension, and empirical testing. Contributions and refinements are welcome through the Dawn Field Theory experimental archive.
