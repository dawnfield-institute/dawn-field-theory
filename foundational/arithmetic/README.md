# 🧮 Arithmetic Directory

Welcome to the **mathematical engine room** of Dawn Field Theory! 🔢 This directory explores symbolic arithmetic foundations, from theoretical mappings to recursive numeric structures. If you love number theory, symbolic logic, and field-aligned computation—this is your space. 🧠

## 📁 Contents

* `hodge_mapping/`

  * `v0.1/` – 📐 Early theoretical work on Hodge mapping and its applications in symbolic arithmetic and field modeling.

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory supports:

* 🧩 Development of symbolic arithmetic primitives
* 🔀 Mapping numeric patterns to recursive field logic
* 🧪 Experimental structures for entropy-aware arithmetic models

Arithmetic here isn’t just math—it’s the **language of symbolic fields**. Dive in if you're building the numerics of recursion and emergence. ✨
