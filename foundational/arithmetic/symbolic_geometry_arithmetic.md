# Symbolic Geometry Arithmetic – Recursive Calculus and Collapse Formalism

## Overview

This document formalizes a new arithmetic framework grounded in symbolic field geometry, recursive calculus operations, and entropy regulation. It synthesizes insights from the *Symbolic Superfluid Collapse Pi* and *Symbolic Fractal Pruning* experiments, advancing the original `infodynamics_arithmetic_v1.md` into a spatially expressive symbolic algebra.

## 1. Symbolic Field Structure

Let a symbolic field $S : \mathbb{Z}^2 \rightarrow \Sigma \cup \{\emptyset\}$ map discrete spatial locations to symbols from alphabet $\Sigma$. Each symbol occupies a unique position and inherits local entropy $H(x, y)$ based on a 3×3 symbolic neighborhood.

## 2. Core Operators

### 2.1 Collapse Pressure Operator $\Pi(x, y)$

$$
\Pi(x, y) = \alpha |\nabla^2 f(x, y)| + \beta ||\nabla f(x, y)||
$$

This quantifies local symbolic tension. $f$ is a symbolic density field, and $\alpha, \beta$ weight Laplacian and gradient contributions.

### 2.2 Entropy Modulation $\gamma(x, y)$

$$
\gamma(x, y) = 1 + \lambda \cdot \frac{H(x, y)}{\max H} \cdot W(x, y) \cdot e^{-\delta(H(x, y) - \bar{H})}
$$

Where:

* $W(x, y)$: Radial basis weight from field center of mass
* $H$: Local Shannon entropy
* $\bar{H}$: Global mean entropy

This governs symbolic resistance to collapse.

### 2.3 Symbolic Prune Condition

A symbol $s \in \Sigma$ is deleted at position $(x, y)$ if:

$$
\Pi(x, y) < T / \gamma(x, y)
$$

Where $T$ is a recursive threshold dynamically adjusted over recursions.

### 2.4 Symbolic Drift $\delta s$

Symbols are probabilistically transferred to adjacent lower-gradient sites:

$$
s_{x, y} \rightarrow s_{x', y'} \text{ where } ||\nabla f(x', y')|| < ||\nabla f(x, y)||
$$

## 3. Recursive Balance and RBF Regulation

Collapse is recursively modulated by deviation from local and global entropy:

$$
R(x, y) = e^{-\epsilon |H(x, y) - \bar{H}|}
$$

This is embedded in $\gamma$, creating symbolic inertia around balance points.

## 4. Collapse Algebra

Define:

* $s_1 \oplus s_2$: collapse (destabilize)
* $s_1 \otimes s_2$: emergence (fusion into new symbol)
* $\delta_s$: decay operator (drift + delete)

These operators are state- and entropy-dependent.

## 5. Experimental Verification

* Collapse curves follow non-linear active symbol decay
* Entropy maps stabilize after recursive penalty enforcement
* Lifetimes exhibit recursive persistence distributions

Refer to:

* [Symbolic Superfluid Collapse Pi Results](../experiments/symbolic_superfluid_collapse_pi/results.md)
* [Symbolic Fractal Pruning Results](../experiments/symbolic_fractal_pruning/results.md)

## 6. Future Extensions

* Higher-order operators: divergence, curl, Ricci-based symbolic flows
* Symbolic generative algebra (with entropy-weighted productions)
* Coupling with agent reasoning models for morphogenetic inference

## Appendix

All metrics, transitions, and collapse logs are archived with each experiment for reproducibility and symbolic trace lineage.
