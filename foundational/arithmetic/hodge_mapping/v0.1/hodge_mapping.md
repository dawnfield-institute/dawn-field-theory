**Symbolic-to-Hodge Mapping Framework**

**Objective:**
To define a constructive correspondence $\phi_k$ between symbolic field outputs from our collapse simulations and the Hodge-theoretic structures that appear in the context of the Hodge Conjecture.

**1. Domain and Codomain**

Let $F: \mathbb{Z}^2 \to [0,1]$ be a symbolic field resulting from recursive collapse, defined on a 2D lattice with modulation constant $n \in \mathbb{R}$.

We define a symbolic-to-Hodge map:

$$
\phi_k : F \mapsto \omega \in H^{k,k}(X) \cap H^{2k}(X, \mathbb{Q})
$$

where $\omega$ is a rational cohomology class on a complex projective variety $X$.

**2. Symbolic Field Structure as a Proxy for Forms**

* Symbolic field attractors approximate low-entropy harmonic modes.
* FFT modes capture angular and radial regularities, analogous to eigenmodes of the Laplacian.
* Radial persistence and symmetry peaks approximate structure in $H^{1,1}(X)$.

Let $\omega_F$ be the 2-form extracted via persistence weighting:

$$
\omega_F = \sum_{r} a_r \delta(r - r_i) \, dr \wedge d\theta
$$

where $r_i$ are radial peak locations and $a_r$ are their FFT-scaled amplitudes.

**3. Rationality and Integrality Inference**

* We associate field stability across mod-$p$ reductions with rational structure.
* Integer peak counts and discrete symmetry suggest candidate integral representatives.

Define an operator $\psi: \omega_F \mapsto \mathbb{Q} \subset H^{2k}(X, \mathbb{Q})$ that tests:

* Persistence of features under symbolic $\mod p$ transforms
* Stability of attractor positions
* Coherence of FFT harmonic modes

---

**4. Cycle Interpretation**

* High-density zones (persistent crystallization) may correspond to algebraic cycles.
* We define a symbolic cycle locator $Z(F) \subset \mathbb{Z}^2$ with stability threshold $\tau$:

$$
Z(F) = \{ (i,j) \in \mathbb{Z}^2 \mid F_{i,j}^{(t)} > \tau \text{ for } t > T_0 \}
$$

These symbolic cycles may approximate support of codimension-$k$ subvarieties in $X$.

---

**5. Goal of $\phi_k$**

To construct:

* An injective map from symbolic collapse attractors to candidate Hodge classes
* A reproducible diagnostic that identifies when a symbolic attractor encodes a rational cohomology class
* A synthetic bridge to test the Hodge Conjecture constructively, from symbolic field theory

---

**Next Steps:**

* Apply $\phi_k$ to symbolic fields modeled on known varieties (e.g., $\mathbb{P}^2$, torus, K3 surface)
* Run simulations with parameter noise to test robustness of $\phi_k$
* Automate symbolic cycle extraction using clustering or topological data analysis
* Extend symbolic collapse simulations to 3D and higher-dimensional lattices
* Compare symbolic cohomology candidates with known (non-)algebraic Hodge classes
* Investigate behavior of mod-$p$ structures under Galois or arithmetic symmetries
* Share this framework publicly to encourage collaboration and critical evaluation
