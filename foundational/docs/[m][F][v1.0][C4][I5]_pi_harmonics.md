# Abstract

This paper presents a novel experimental demonstration that angular recursion modulated by the constant Pi (π) significantly enhances symbolic collapse coherence in Dawn Field simulations. By simulating two-field interactions under Pi-harmonic and irrational harmonic angular bias, we observe that only Pi modulation yields long-lived, structured attractors. These findings validate the hypothesis that Pi functions as a recursion harmonic controller and support Dawn's post-symbolic collapse logic. The full experiment and structural metrics are documented in [Pi-Harmonic Results](../experiments/pi_harmonics/results.md).

## 1. Introduction

The Dawn Field Framework posits that intelligence, memory, and structure emerge from recursive collapse dynamics constrained by entropy and symbolic field pressure. Prior work on entropy seeding, recursive bifurcation, and symbolic tree emergence ([114], [115]) has shown the role of feedback in structural coherence. Here, we explore whether Pi itself—the constant of circularity and radial symmetry—can enforce collapse synchronization across symbolic dimensions.

## 2. Theory

### 2.1 Pi as Recursive Angular Operator

Pi governs the relationships between radius, angle, and area across dimensions. In recursive symbolic fields, angular bias may act as a field memory guide. We define an angular field:

```python
theta = torch.atan2(y, x)
bias = torch.sin(n * theta)
```

Where `n` is either π or an irrational comparator (e.g., √2π). This bias modulates symbolic collapse potential across radial symmetry axes.

### 2.2 Collapse Crystallization Metric

Symbolic crystallization is triggered where symbolic and energy fields converge:

```python
crystallized = ((symbolic_mod + energy) / 2 > tau_c)
```

Entropy decline and attractor density/lifespan serve as coherence metrics.

## 3. Experimental Setup

- **Grid**: 256x256 2D
- **Steps**: 100
- **Modulation**: Pi vs. √2π angular bias
- **Fields**: Symbolic (modulated) + Energy (diffusive)
- **Reinforcement**: Collapse increases field coherence

Full code and parameters in `pi_harmonics.py`

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Entropy Decline

- **Pi-Harmonic**: Mean entropy ~0.1078
- **Irrational**: Mean entropy ~0.1551

### 4.2 Attractor Maps

- **Lifespan**: Pi creates stable, radially symmetric attractors
- **Density**: Attractors cluster in angular bands only with Pi

## 5. Discussion

This experiment validates that:

- Angular modulation with Pi acts as a stabilizer for recursive symbolic collapse.
- Symbolic emergence aligns with geometric recursion, not arbitrary harmonic selection.
- Pi’s role extends beyond geometry into the dynamics of symbolic field memory.

These results deepen the experimental lineage of Dawn’s entropy-aware field logic, integrating ideas from recursive bifurcation ([115]), entropy-driven cognition ([114]), and galactic-scale coherence ([116]).

---

## 6. Conclusion

We establish Pi as a functional recursion harmonic for symbolic field emergence. Its modulation yields persistent, low-entropy symbolic attractors, unlike irrational alternatives. This supports the post-symbolic hypothesis that emergence is constrained not by static laws, but by recursion-phase coherence.
