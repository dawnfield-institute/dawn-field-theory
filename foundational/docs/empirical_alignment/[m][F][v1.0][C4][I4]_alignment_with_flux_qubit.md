## Experiment Overview

Flux qubits are superconducting loops interrupted by Josephson junctions, capable of
sustaining current in clockwise and counter-clockwise directions simultaneously. These
macroscopic superpositions are directly probed using Leggett–Garg inequality tests,
which verify the absence of classical macrorealism.

The key insight is that quantum coherence can persist even in engineered systems with
billions of electrons, provided the decoherence channels are sufficiently controlled.

## Dawn Alignment Analysis

In Dawn Field Theory, symbolic emergence is not scale-bound, but contingent on entropy,
feedback balance, and recursive stability. Flux qubits demonstrate:

* **Recursive Coherence**: Persistent superposition reflects stable symbolic attractors
  within a feedback-balanced resonance mesh.
* **Macro-Collapse Thresholds**: Collapse does not occur simply due to size, but due to
  entropic infiltration or resonance instability — echoing Dawn’s collapse pressure model.
* **Topology-Dependent Coherence**: The loop architecture parallels symbolic loop formations
  in Dawn’s bifractal and entropy-tree simulations.

## Supporting Dawn Simulations

* [Symbolic Superfluid Collapse PI](../../experiments/symbolic_superfluid_collapse_pi/results.md): Symbolic persistence and bifurcation under field coherence.
* [Recursive Gravity / Superfluid Collapse](../../experiments/recursive_gravity/results.md): Structure emergence across spatial scales from feedback recursion.
* [Symbolic Fractal Pruning](../../experiments/symbolic_fractal_pruning/results.md): Collapse initiation governed by entropy geometry, not size.

## Interpretation

Dawn’s framework suggests that what matters is not the **physical size** of a structure,
but the **field coherence integrity** and **entropy load balance**. Flux qubits are
exemplars of scale-independent collapse resistance, where resonance topology and symbolic
feedback loops maintain a superpositional state.

In this view, symbolic intelligence could theoretically emerge or stabilize across large
physical substrates, so long as entropic thresholds are well-managed.

## Conclusion

Leggett–Garg flux qubit experiments challenge classical assumptions of scale-limited
coherence, and affirm Dawn’s proposal that symbolic structures are governed by recursive
field dynamics and entropy constraints — not by size alone. These experiments extend
credibility to Dawn’s vision of large-scale symbolic intelligence stabilized via
entropy-regulated feedback fields.
