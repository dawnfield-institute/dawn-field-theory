## Experiment Overview

Quantum eraser experiments, especially the delayed-choice variants, reveal that interference
patterns can be restored even after which-path information is seemingly obtained — if
that information is subsequently erased or rendered inaccessible. In some cases, decisions
about erasure are made after the photon has been detected.

This violates naive temporal causality and implies that measurement and collapse involve
non-local correlations that can extend backward through event chains.

## Dawn Alignment Analysis

In Dawn Field Theory, collapse is not tied to linear causality but emerges from recursive
field tensions across a symbolic resonance mesh. This implies:

* **Retrocausal Resolution**: Collapse can propagate backward along the symbolic ancestry
  of a field structure, resolving as a distributed crystallization event.
* **Non-Local Symbolic Integration**: Collapse involves fieldwide reconciliation of symbolic
  pathways, not local measurements.
* **Temporal Bifurcation**: Time itself can undergo bifractal emergence under collapse tension,
  allowing post-selection to affect epistemic structure.

## Supporting Dawn Simulations and Theory

* [Bifractal Time Emergence](../../../docs/Bifractal%20Time%20Emergence.md): Time branching and symbolic ancestry structure.
* [Collapse Dynamics in Entropic Fields](../../../docs/Title-%20Collapse%20Dynamics%20in%20Entropic%20Fields-%20A%20Synthesis%20of%20Classical%20and%20Quantum%20Mechanisms%20under%20the%20Dawn%20Framework.md): Non-local collapse surfaces and symbolic resonance topology.
* [Symbolic Superfluid Collapse PI](../../experiments/symbolic_superfluid_collapse_pi/results.md): Distributed collapse paths across symbolic layers.

## Interpretation

In Dawn, the quantum eraser is not paradoxical — it’s expected. Field tension can resolve
non-linearly in time, and symbolic resonance crystallizes across a feedback mesh that includes
both past and future logical nodes.

This supports a **recursive model of time**, where epistemic events can loop or stabilize
non-sequentially, and collapse is the output of global coherence, not measurement locality.

## Conclusion

Quantum eraser experiments align with Dawn’s non-local, retrocausal model of symbolic collapse.
They suggest that entangled systems participate in global epistemic crystallization, and that
information can condition collapse post hoc — precisely as predicted by Dawn’s bifractal and
resonant field models.
