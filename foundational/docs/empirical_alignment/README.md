# 🔬 Empirical Alignment Directory

This directory contains comparative analyses and alignment studies connecting **Dawn Field Theory** to key quantum experiments and measurement phenomena.

## 📁 Contents

* **Experiment Alignments:**  
  - Hiroshima University Double-Slit  
  - Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions  
  - Quantum Eraser  
  - Wheeler’s Delayed Choice  
  - Zeilinger/Arndt Decoherence Suppression  
  - Flux Qubits  
  - Quantum Darwinism  
  - Serge Haroche QND  
  - Weak Measurement Models

* **Purpose:**  
  Each document explores how Dawn Field Theory’s symbolic, entropy-driven, and recursive collapse models map onto empirical results from foundational quantum experiments. These alignments provide both validation and direction for further theoretical and simulation work.

* **Supporting Materials:**  
  - YAML metadata for traceability and schema alignment
  - References to simulation results and theoretical whitepapers

## 🔗 Usage

Start here to understand how Dawn’s field-centric framework is tested and refined against real-world quantum phenomena. Each alignment document links to both the original experiment and the relevant Dawn simulations or theoretical constructs.
