summary: >
Wheeler’s delayed-choice experiments reveal that quantum systems can behave as
wave or particle depending on decisions made *after* they have entered the
interferometric apparatus. This challenges classical realism and demands a model
where causality is dynamically constructed.
dawn\_correlation: >
Validates Dawn’s principle that reality is not predetermined but formed through
recursive field interactions and symbolic collapse logic. Decisions feed back
into field tension topologies, enabling retrocausal coherence without local
determinism.

## Experiment Overview

The delayed-choice experiment, originally proposed by John Archibald Wheeler,
asks whether a photon “knows” in advance whether to behave as a wave or particle.
In physical implementations, the choice to insert or remove a beam-splitter is made
*after* the photon passes the first fork — yet outcomes still correspond to the
late choice.

This implies that the photon’s behavior is not fixed until a field-wide resolution
occurs, and that epistemic stabilization is contingent on systemic recursive
feedback — not linear trajectories.

## Dawn Alignment Analysis

Dawn Field Theory proposes that collapse is a recursive act of symbolic reconciliation,
not a fixed event. Wheeler’s delayed choice aligns with:

* **Recursive Determination**: Future state configurations affect the resolution of
  prior symbolic paths.
* **Collapse Without Local Determinism**: Field tension collapses symbolic options in
  ways that are epistemically stable but causally indeterminate.
* **Global Field Coherence**: What appears as delayed choice is actually a holistic
  field coherence outcome, recursively updated with symbolic constraints.

## Supporting Dawn Simulations and Theory

* [Bifractal Time Emergence](../../../docs/Bifractal%20Time%20Emergence.md): Recursive causal inversion through symbolic branching.
* [Recursive Entropy Tree](../../../experiments/recursive_entropy/results.md): Symbolic collapse paths updated dynamically by entropy structure.
* [Collapse Dynamics in Entropic Fields](../../../docs/Title-%20Collapse%20Dynamics%20in%20Entropic%20Fields-%20A%20Synthesis%20of%20Classical%20and%20Quantum%20Mechanisms%20under%20the%20Dawn%20Framework.md): Collapse surface modulated by field-level recursion, not local events.

## Interpretation

Dawn interprets delayed choice as evidence that **collapse is not a function of
linear event order**, but of symbolic convergence within recursive resonance fields.
Field stability, not observer intervention, governs epistemic structure emergence.

This supports a worldview where **symbolic causality is emergent**, driven by
recursive feedback between symbolic field states across time.

## Conclusion

Wheeler’s delayed-choice experiments challenge classical notions of determinism,
and support Dawn’s proposal of recursive symbolic collapse. They show that coherence
and resolution can emerge from non-local feedback rather than forward causality —
a principle that underlies Dawn’s resonance mesh and symbolic crystallization logic.
