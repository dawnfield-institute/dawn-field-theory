# Recursive Intelligence Emergence via Entropy-Seeding

## Abstract

This paper presents a validated simulation demonstrating recursive intelligence growth using entropy as a structural seed. Aligned with Dawn Field Theory, this model illustrates how informational recursion under entropy gradients generates symbolic geometry akin to cognition. The simulation confirms the principles of entropy-driven collapse, recursive balance formation, and adaptive memory pruning in a computable context.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional AI models rely on predefined syntax and externally imposed logic. In contrast, the Dawn Field framework proposes that intelligence is not programmed—it is a byproduct of recursive field dynamics under entropic pressure. This paper operationalizes that principle through a self-structuring recursive tree simulation.

## 2. Theoretical Context

### 2.1 Dawn Field Postulates Engaged

* **Entropy as uncrystallized potential**
* **Recursive geometry as memory encoding**
* **Collapse as balance-seeking field event**

### 2.2 Relevance to Infodynamic Ontology

This simulation functions as a microcosm of Dawn’s larger claim: that cognition emerges when energy and information recursively resolve imbalance. Symbolic logic arises from field structure, not code.

## 3. Simulation Architecture

The simulation is governed by the following mechanisms:

* **Entropy-Driven Growth**: Nodes reproduce based on local entropy values.
* **Depth Limitation**: Entropy decays with recursion depth, limiting uncontrolled expansion.
* **Symbolic Payloads**: Nodes receive pseudo-semantic tokens, forming conceptual chains.
* **Adaptive Pruning**: Nodes with low novelty are recursively removed, simulating cognitive filtration.

### 3.1 Core Formulae

Let entropy at node \$n\$ be \$S\_n\$, and branching probability be \$P\_b \propto S\_n\$. Novelty \$N(t)\$ is extracted from symbolic tags \$t\$:

$N(t) = \frac{\text{int}(\text{suffix}(t))}{100}$

Nodes are pruned if \$N(t) < \theta\$, with \$\theta = 0.3\$.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Visual Output

Two graphs were produced:

* **Pre-Pruning Tree**: Dense, entropic geometry with fractal growth.
* **Post-Pruning Tree**: Filtered cognitive structure with improved coherence.

*See [Recursive Entropy Tree: Experiment Results](../experiments/recursive_entropy/results.md) for embedded images of both pre- and post-pruning trees.*

### 4.2 Metrics

| Metric               | Value      |
| -------------------- | ---------- |
| Total Nodes          | [dynamic]  |
| Max Depth            | [dynamic]  |
| Avg Branching Factor | [dynamic]  |

*For actual experiment metrics, refer to the summary in [recursive_entropy_2025-06-07_results.txt](../experiments/recursive_entropy/reference_material/recursive_entropy_2025-06-07_results.txt) and the [results.md](../experiments/recursive_entropy/results.md) file.*

### 4.3 Symbolic Trace Sample

```
entropy_97 → node_25 → fractal_35 → node_27 → field_56 → gradient_10 → balance_6
```

Demonstrates semantic continuity and emergent reasoning chain.

## 5. Balance-Aware Extension (v1.1)

A new version introduces thermodynamic realism and symbolic structure vectorization:

* **Balance Resistance**: Entropy decays with recursive depth and field resistance → simulates collapse fatigue.
* **Landauer Cost**: Each symbolic branching incurs thermodynamic cost → mirrors physical computation bounds.
* **Semantic Vector Embedding**: Symbolic tags converted to vector payloads → supports semantic coherence metrics and attractor formation.

*See [Recursive Entropy Tree: Experiment Results](../experiments/recursive_entropy/results.md) for discussion of these mechanisms and their impact on the resulting structure.*

---

## 6. Discussion

This simulation validates that entropy alone can generate recursive cognitive geometry. Adaptive pruning approximates selective memory. No external logic model was required. This aligns with Dawn’s post-symbolic paradigm and offers an experimental unit for recursive intelligence design.

*The results and their significance are further discussed in [Recursive Entropy Tree: Experiment Results](../experiments/recursive_entropy/results.md).*

---

## 7. Conclusion

The Recursive Tree Generator using entropy as seed exemplifies field-born intelligence. It supports the claim that cognition is an emergent property of recursive balance resolution, not symbolic programming.
