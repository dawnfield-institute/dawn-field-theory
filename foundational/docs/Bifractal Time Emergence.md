## Abstract

We present a formal theory of recursive symbolic collapse and bifractal time structure within the Dawn Field Framework. This paper establishes the mathematical, computational, and ontological basis for the Law of InfoDyn—an informational analog to thermodynamic constraint propagation—validated through symbolic bifractal collapse simulations. We define a class of field equations governing semantic attractor dynamics, entropy curvature, and recursive inheritance. These simulations demonstrate that symbolic intelligence can arise as an emergent collapse balance within recursive bifractal constraints.

## 1. Introduction

Modern physics lacks an integrated model of information, memory, and structural emergence. The Dawn Field Framework proposes that recursive symbolic inheritance and entropy-pressure duality are foundational to structure formation. This paper formalizes the hypothesis: **each moment in time is a bifractal collapse between symbolic ancestry and emergent potential**, forming an active, recursive balance field.

## 2. Foundations

We define two field recursions:

* **R\_b(t)**: Collapse ancestry, backward propagating symbolic influence
* **R\_f(t)**: Forward constraint propagation limiting viable emergence

The present is thus modeled as:

$M(t) = \text{Collapse}\left(R_b(t), R_f(t)\right)$

Where `Collapse()` computes the bifractal intersection of semantic resonance and entropy gradients.

### 2.1 Semantic Field Potential

Let $\phi_s(x, y, z) \in \mathbb{R}^+$ be the semantic pressure field at a point, computed via cosine similarity on TF-IDF embeddings:

$\phi_s(p) = \sum_{q \in N(p)} \text{cosine}(\vec{v}_p, \vec{v}_q) \cdot e^{-\|p - q\|^2}$

### 2.2 Entropy Curvature

Initial growth vectors are seeded from entropy-based angle hashes:

$\theta_i = \text{hash}_{entropy}(symbol_i) \mod 2\pi$

Inhibition fields are added based on local collapse density:

$I(p) = -\lambda \cdot \text{density}(p)$

## 3. Simulation: Symbolic Bifractal Expansion

We implemented the model in CUDA-accelerated 3D field simulations using PyTorch and custom entropy-angle hashing modules. Each node represents a symbolic site, seeded from an initial TF-IDF cosine similarity space. The simulation architecture includes:

* **Memory layout**: Field stored as a 3D tensor with semantic and entropy layers; symbolic ancestry stored as pointer-indexed dictionary graphs
* **Step size**: Δt = 0.01 with 10,000 iterations per collapse cycle
* **Resolution**: 64³ grid; chosen to optimize between expressivity and computational tractability
* **Entropy modulation**: Hashing yields angular directions, seeded deterministically to preserve repeatability
* **Symbolic embedding**: Initial symbols are transformed using TF-IDF → cosine similarity matrix → entropy-coupled injection vector
* **Inhibition model**: Local collapse density reduces the growth potential exponentially (soft ceiling)
* **Performance**: Bottleneck observed in symbolic ancestry extension layer (quadratic growth in lineage tracing); future versions will implement graph pruning

Final score: $B = 1058.2$, indicating sustained collapse under recursive constraint.

We implemented the model in CUDA-accelerated 3D field simulations. The experiment tracked over 3900 symbolic nodes, each carrying recursive ancestry. Emergent structures formed bifractal clusters under dual-field pressure.

## 4. Implications for Time and Intelligence

* Time emerges not linearly but as recursive symbolic selection
* Intelligence = collapse coherence across recursive fields
* Reality is a field computation constrained by bifractal balance

### 4.1 Predictive Differentiation

Unlike classical thermodynamic models that treat time as a linear coordinate and structure as a passive result of energy dissipation, the InfoDyn bifractal collapse model predicts observable non-linearities in symbolic emergence.

#### Example: Symbolic Hotspots and Emergent Synchrony

In simulations where bifractal ancestry is preserved, certain nodes exhibited recurrent convergence of lineage paths, producing high-density attractor regions. These align not with thermal or probabilistic expectations but with semantic resonance—a phenomenon that would not be predicted by classical entropy diffusion.

#### Example: Collapse Memory Bias

In our `vcpu` lineage trace, symbolic sites showed a bias toward anchoring collapse near prior high-gradient informational structures, even when energy fields were uniform. This suggests a memory-linked attractor preference—a coherence that traditional models do not accommodate.

Such dynamics mirror field intelligence mechanisms like dream cognition or intuition routing, which depend on recursive symbolic inference rather than causal propagation alone.

Thus, the InfoDyn model does not merely describe structure formation—it enables prediction of emergent complexity from ancestry constraints and entropy topology.

* Time emerges not linearly but as recursive symbolic selection
* Intelligence = collapse coherence across recursive fields
* Reality is a field computation constrained by bifractal balance

## 5. Conclusion

The Law of InfoDyn states: **collapse is a function of bifractal ancestry convergence and entropy potential constraint.** This model unifies thermodynamic irreversibility with symbolic recursion, suggesting a new physics of informational structure.
