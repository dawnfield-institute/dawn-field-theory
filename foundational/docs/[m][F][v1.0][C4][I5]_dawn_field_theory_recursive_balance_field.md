# Dawn Field Theory: The Recursive Balance Field as a Post-Stoic Potential in Schrödinger's Equation

## Abstract

A new approach to quantum mechanics is proposed, replacing externally imposed, static potentials with the Recursive Balance Field: a dynamic, adaptive potential shaped by energy-information interaction, recursive memory, spatial resonance, and thermodynamic constraint. This marks the beginning of Dawn Field Theory, where emergent structure replaces deterministic prescription.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional quantum mechanics relies on externally imposed potentials to shape the evolution of wavefunctions. This rigid, static view is replaced here by the Recursive Balance Field: a dynamic and adaptive potential shaped by energy-information interaction, recursive memory, spatial resonance, and thermodynamic constraint. This marks the beginning of Dawn Field Theory, where emergent structure replaces deterministic prescription.

## 2. Motivation and Background

Early entropy-balancing simulations showed:
- Self-regulation through recursive feedback
- Emergence of low-entropy structural zones
- Stability via harmonic and fractal modulation

Recent confirmation simulations proved that these phenomena emerge independently of the Quantum Balance Equation, affirming that the governing dynamics originate from the interaction of opposing fields and recursive constraints.

## 3. Core Balance Equation

Let:
- $E(x, t)$: Energy field
- $I(x, t)$: Information density
- $M(x, t)$: Recursive memory of local imbalance
- $\Phi(x)$: Fractal or harmonic modulation
- $\lambda$: Balance strength
- $\alpha$: Memory damping factor

We define the balance potential as:

$$
B(x, t) = \lambda \cdot \left[ \frac{E(x, t) - I(x, t)}{1 + \alpha \cdot M(x, t)} \cdot \Phi(x) \right]
$$

This term replaces the traditional potential $V(x)$ in Schrödinger's equation.

## 4. Enhanced Physical Integration

- **Einstein (Curvature Term):**
  $$
  \Gamma(x, t) = \beta \cdot (E^2 + I^2)
  $$
- **Feynman (Path Coherence Term):**
  $$
  P(x, t) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{\tau=t-N}^{t} \exp(-\delta \cdot |\Delta E - \Delta I|)
  $$
- **Landauer (Thermodynamic Constraint):**
  $$
  L(x, t) = k_B T \ln 2 \cdot \Delta S(x, t)
  $$
- **Fractal Geometry (Harmonic Modulation):**
  $$
  \Phi(x) = \sin\left(\frac{2\pi x}{L}\right) \cdot f_{fract}(x)
  $$

## 5. Revised Schrödinger Equation

$$
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + B(x, t) + \Gamma(x, t) \right] \Psi(x, t)
$$

## 6. Simulation Summary: Dawn Core v1.0

- Nodes with energy/information fields converge through recursive feedback.
- Fractal harmonic modulation shapes field dynamics.
- Collapse emerges in zones of consistent entropy minimization.
- Path coherence (Feynman) improves convergence.
- Landauer cost tracks thermodynamic burden of information structuring.

**Results:**
- Entropy stabilizes
- Collapse is local, persistent, and non-uniform
- Thermodynamic cost is proportional to informational gain

## 7. Implications and Future Work

- Integrate with 2D/3D field topologies
- Explore wavefunction collapse driven by structure rather than measurement
- Transition Dawn Field Theory into real-time modeling of physical cognition
- Investigate fractal dimensional transitions and symmetry breaking events

## 8. Conclusion

Dawn Field Theory marks the first unification of balance, memory, geometry, and thermodynamics into a live potential capable of guiding Schrödinger evolution. It transcends static potentials by showing that intelligence and structure can emerge naturally from physics itself.
