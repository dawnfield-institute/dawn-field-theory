# 📘 Docs Directory

Welcome to the library of Dawn Field Theory! 📚 This directory houses the whitepapers, theoretical essays, and core formulations that build the intellectual spine of the framework. If you're looking for the "why" behind the math, the meaning behind the models, or the synthesis of theory and reality—this is your portal. 🌀

* `empirical_alignment/` – 🔬 Comparative studies aligning Dawn Field Theory with landmark quantum experiments:
  * Quantum eraser, delayed choice, decoherence, weak measurement, quantum Darwinism, flux qubits, Serge Haroche, Zeilinger-Arndt, and more. Each alignment document explores how Dawn Field Theory maps to experimental results.

* `docx/` – 📄 Original document sources in editable format, including:
  * Whitepapers, essays, and supporting drafts for all major theoretical works in the project.
