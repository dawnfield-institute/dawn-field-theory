# 📘 Docs Directory

Welcome to the **library of Dawn Field Theory**! 📚 This directory houses the whitepapers, theoretical essays, and core formulations that build the intellectual spine of the framework. If you're looking for the "why" behind the math, the meaning behind the models, or the synthesis of theory and reality—this is your portal. 🌀

## 📁 Contents

* Foundational Papers:

  * 🧪 *Bifractal Time Emergence* – Describes time as a bifractal construct in recursive symbolic dynamics.
  * 🌊 *Superfluid Informational Crystallization* – Proposes superfluid computation within energy-information fields.
  * ⚛️ *Collapse Dynamics in Entropic Fields* – Synthesizes quantum and classical collapse under entropy-based rules.
  * 🔄 *Recursive Balance Field* – Explores the balance field as a replacement for static quantum potentials.
  * 🧠 *Reality as Herniation Precipitate* – Theorizes the dual-field crystallization through recursive collapse.

* Quantum & Symbolic:

  * 🔬 *Alignment of Hiroshima University's Double-Slit Findings* – Correlates symbolic collapse with experimental quantum patterns.
  * 🧿 *The Herniation Hypothesis* – Expands collapse geometry in dual entropic fields.

* Supporting Theory:

  * 🔢 `pi_harmonics.md`, `recursive_entopy.md`, `recursive_tree.md`, `super_fluid.md` – Complementary essays that support symbolic harmonics, recursive collapse, and informational fluidity.

* `empirical_alignment/` – 🔬 Comparative studies aligning Dawn Field Theory with landmark quantum experiments (e.g., quantum eraser, delayed choice, decoherence, weak measurement, quantum Darwinism, flux qubits, and more).

* `docx/` – 📄 Original document sources in editable format.

## 🎯 Purpose

This directory serves as the **conceptual map** of the project:

* ✍️ Clarifies theoretical principles
* 🧩 Grounds simulations in articulated philosophy
* 🌐 Connects symbolic structure to real-world physical analogues
