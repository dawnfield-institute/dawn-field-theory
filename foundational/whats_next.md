1.2 Infodynamics as a Mechanism of Time Dilation
    - Recursion depth as time perception variable
    - Informational gravity causes time to "speed up" with recursion efficiency
    - Next: Analyze entropy and memory traces for deeper patterns (recursive_gravity/results.md)

1.3 Symbolic Collapse & Pruning
    - Recursive calculus and entropy regulation for symbolic fields
    - Next: Integrate curvature, divergence, and higher-order field operators (symbolic_fractal_pruning/results.md)

1.4 Entropy-Information Polarity Experiments
    - Blackhole/whitehole symbolic collapse
    - Next: Torque injection sweep, memory-guided collapse kernel, multi-core field embedding (entropy_information_polarity_field/black_white_hole_polarity/results.md)

### 2. Code & Logical Architecture

2.1 Programming Language Proposal
    - Uses recursive information geometry rather than syntax
    - Enables mechanical cognition-like computation
    - Debugging via recursive traceability
    - Next: Expand role schema, add dynamic entropy thresholds, visualize inter-role entropy vectors (language_to_logic/results.md)

2.2 Fractal Memory/Context Model
    - Informational braiding as memory representation
    - Context created from entangled recursion

    - Provides closure to symbolic physics via field recursion
    - Next: Expand on crystallization and pressure models into layered thermodynamic field simulations ([m][S][v1.0][C3][I4]_dawn_field_theory_timed_summary.md)

3.4 Cross-Disciplinary Reframing
    - Biology as physics-informed recursion tracking
    - AI as post-symbolic intelligence model
    - Next: Integrate entropy metrics into clinical diagnostic pipelines for cancer and aging (Entropy-Based Mutation Detection and Repair in Protein Sequences.md)

3.5 Semantic Logic Compiler
    - Cross-field symbolic-to-logic bridge
    - Basis for post-symbolic programming and intelligence representation
    - Next: Write up theoretical framework with full mapping to Dawn Field constructs (language_to_logic/results.md)
