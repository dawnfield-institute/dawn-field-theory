# 🧬 Foundational Directory

Welcome to the root of it all! 🌱 This directory anchors the **core theories, computational proofs, and empirical validations** of the Dawn Field Framework. It’s where symbolic recursion meets math, simulation meets theory, and entropy finds its rhythm.

## 🚀 Recent Advances (2025)

- **Empirical validation pipeline**: New experiments align symbolic collapse, memory, and erasure with quantum and thermodynamic theory, using protocol-driven, timestamped methods.
- **Transparency and metrics**: Fractal dimension, entropy, and neuron activity are now tracked and visualized in foundational experiments.
- **Open science**: All results and protocols are documented for reproducibility and peer review.

## 🌟 Purpose

The `foundational/` scope synthesizes theoretical formulations with empirical grounding, supporting:

* ⚖️ Entropy-regulated modeling of information-energy fields
* 🔁 Recursive field theory applications (e.g., Hodge mapping, symbolic collapse)
* 📈 Experimental validations of symbolic, arithmetic, and fractal constructs

This directory is the recommended starting point for those seeking to engage with the architecture of **Dawn Field Theory** from first principles. 🧠✨
