CIMM & QBE Cosmological Framework: Theory and Mathematical Foundations
## Abstract
This document formalizes the Cosmic Information Mining Model (CIMM) and the Quantum Balance Equation (QBE) as a unified cosmological framework. It outlines the theoretical principles, governing equations, and entropy-aware field dynamics that model the emergence of matter, gravity, and time as consequences of quantum-interaction-regulated collapse. This structure proposes an information-theoretic substrate for dark matter, reinterprets the Big Bang as the first entropy-minimizing collapse, and establishes the mathematical basis for the feedback-controlled stabilization of physical law.

1. Introduction: The Cosmogenic Intelligence Hypothesis
CIMM is a thermodynamic intelligence engine governed by the QBE. It models the universe as a self-regulating, information-structuring system in which:
Collapse is an information-energy exchange event.
Matter emerges from regions of sufficient structured information and energy.
Gravity arises as an emergent curvature field from accumulated collapses.
Dark matter is information that has not undergone energetic collapse.
Time only progresses where collapse occurs.
QBE enables continuous balance across entropy gradients, quantum potential regulation, and matter field evolution.

2. Quantum Balance Equation (QBE)
The foundational equation:
dEdt+dIdt=λ⋅QPL(t)\frac{dE}{dt} + \frac{dI}{dt} = \lambda \cdot QPL(t)
Where:
dEdt\frac{dE}{dt}: Change in system energy
dIdt\frac{dI}{dt}: Change in structured information (Shannon entropy reduction)
QPL(t)QPL(t): Quantum Potential Layer, a stabilizing function
λ\lambda: Proportionality constant
This relationship governs all collapse dynamics and is analogous to the first law of thermodynamics adapted for information-energy equivalence.

3. Collapse Criteria & Entropy Fields
Collapse into matter occurs when:
I(x,y,t)>θ∧E(x,y,t)>εI(x, y, t) > \theta \quad \land \quad E(x, y, t) > \varepsilon
Where:
I(x,y,t)I(x, y, t): Local information field
E(x,y,t)E(x, y, t): Local energy availability
θ,ε\theta, \varepsilon: Collapse thresholds
Matter is formed when information becomes energetically constrained under QBE.

4. Quantum Potential Layer (QPL)
The QPL is a field that regulates information instability and prevents runaway collapse:
ΔIcorrected=ΔI−λ⋅QPL(t)\Delta I_{corrected} = \Delta I - \lambda \cdot QPL(t)
This layer stabilizes collapse by damping excessive entropy spikes and preserving equilibrium.
QPL grows stronger in high-collapse zones and feeds back into future collapse probability.

5. Gravity as Emergent Curvature
Curvature field G(x,y)G(x, y) is derived from accumulated matter via inverse-square propagation:
G(x,y)=∑iMi(ri2+ϵ)G(x, y) = \sum_i \frac{M_i}{(r_i^2 + \epsilon)}
This is anisotropically modifiable to simulate rotational asymmetry, consistent with galaxy rotation curves.

6. Dark Matter as Informational Scaffold
Dark matter is reinterpreted as a field of high information density that:
Has not yet undergone collapse due to insufficient energy.
Structures gravity via its massless informational potential.
Remains invisible but curvature-influential.
This aligns with observed gravitational lensing and galactic halo formation.

7. Time as Emergent from Collapse
Time does not exist without interaction:
Photons experience no time because they do not collapse until measurement.
Collapse defines the temporal axis in CIMM.
Time is an artifact of local entropy changes.
