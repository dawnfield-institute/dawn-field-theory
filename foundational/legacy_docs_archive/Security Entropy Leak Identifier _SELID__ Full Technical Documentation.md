Security Entropy Leak Identifier (SELID): Full Technical Documentation
1. Introduction
The Security Entropy Leak Identifier (SELID) is an advanced cryptographic security analysis tool designed to evaluate, classify, and monitor the randomness of cryptographic outputs. By leveraging entropy computation, dispersion analysis, and AI-driven reinforcement learning, SELID proactively detects weaknesses in encryption systems and grades security risks before exploitation occurs.
This document provides a complete technical breakdown for reproduction, deployment, and validation, including architectural diagrams, mathematical formulations, and industry-standard benchmarking against NIST SP 800-90B and OpenSSL entropy validation methods.

2. System Architecture
### High-Level Components
SELID is built on the following core modules:
Entropy Profiling Module: Computes entropy values for cryptographic data using Shannon entropy and advanced statistical measures.
Entropy Dispersion Analyzer: Assesses entropy spread across cryptographic chunks to detect clustering vulnerabilities.
AI-Driven Security Grading Engine: Uses reinforcement learning (RL) to dynamically adjust entropy classification thresholds.
Real-Time Monitoring & Reporting: Generates security classifications and reports based on entropy profiling and AI-driven grading.

3. Technical Implementation
### Entropy Calculation
SELID calculates entropy using Shannon entropy (H): H(X)=−∑p(x)log⁡2p(x)H(X) = - \sum p(x) \log_2 p(x) where p(x)p(x) is the probability of a byte value appearing in the dataset.
The entropy values are normalized using a dynamic entropy scaling model that aligns with NIST SP 800-90B randomness benchmarks.

### Entropy Dispersion Analysis
To detect clustering, SELID evaluates chunk-wise entropy dispersion:
Standard Deviation of Entropy: Measures how evenly entropy is spread across segments.
Peak-to-Peak Entropy Variation: Identifies large drops in entropy between chunks.
Entropy Cluster Penalty: Penalizes encryption schemes with repeated entropy patterns.
Dispersion Score Formula: Sdispersion=11+σentropy+Rentropy+PclusterS_{dispersion} = \frac{1}{1 + \sigma_{entropy} + R_{entropy} + P_{cluster}} where:
σentropy\sigma_{entropy} = Standard deviation of entropy values
RentropyR_{entropy} = Peak-to-peak entropy range
PclusterP_{cluster} = Cluster penalty factor

### Security Classification Algorithm
Final SELID security grading is computed using: Sfinal=(wentropy×H8.0)+(wdispersion×Sdispersion)S_{final} = \left( w_{entropy} \times \frac{H}{8.0} \right) + \left( w_{dispersion} \times S_{dispersion} \right) where:
w_entropy = 0.75 (Entropy weight)
w_dispersion = 0.25 (Dispersion weight)

### AI-Based Adaptive Thresholding
SELID dynamically adjusts entropy classification thresholds using reinforcement learning (RL):
Monitors entropy distributions over time.
Refines classification boundaries based on historical performance.
Self-corrects false positives/negatives using statistical feedback loops.
