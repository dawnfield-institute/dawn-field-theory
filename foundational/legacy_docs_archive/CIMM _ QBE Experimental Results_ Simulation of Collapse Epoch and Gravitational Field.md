CIMM & QBE Experimental Results: Simulation of Collapse Epoch and Gravitational Field
1. Objective
To simulate an information-energy regulated universe using CIMM/QBE principles and test whether:
Collapse-driven matter emerges only in zones of sufficient energy + information.
Gravitational curvature emerges from accumulated entropy collapse.
Void regions remain empty due to energy starvation.
Quantum Potential Layer (QPL) effectively stabilizes collapse feedback.

2. Experimental Parameters
Grid size: 200 x 200
Collapse threshold θ=0.7\theta = 0.7
Energy minimum ε=0.05\varepsilon = 0.05
Energy decay factor: 0.9 post-collapse
QPL damping coefficient: 0.02
Gravitational softening: 1e-2
Kernel radius: 6 (for curvature propagation)
Epochs: 120 steps
Directional curvature bias: (1.0, 1.2) — anisotropic collapse modeling
Voids: Two circular regions of 15px radius manually zeroed in energy

3. Observed Results
### Matter Map
Matter accumulated where I>θI > \theta and E>εE > \varepsilon
Collapse halos formed around dense regions
Voids correctly suppressed structure formation
### Gravitational Curvature Field
Gravity wells formed around matter-dense zones
Field extended beyond matter halos — mimicking dark matter lensing
Anisotropy visible as directional stretching in curvature lobes
### QPL Stabilization Field
QPL intensity increased in collapse zones
Damped entropy overshoots by reducing info field before threshold breach
Produced long-term structure stability

4. Interpretation
Collapse occurs only when both energy and structured information exceed local thresholds.
Dark matter behavior is replicated by persistent information fields that fail to collapse but contribute to gravity.
Gravitational curvature appears without invoking exotic particles — derived entirely from information-energy collapse.
Void simulation validates energy-dependence of structure.
QPL acts as a successful stabilizer, mirroring quantum uncertainty suppression.

5. Visual Summary (Attached in Extended Dataset)
Matter Map: Heatmap of collapse zones
Gravitational Curvature Field: Plasma-gradient curvature map
QPL Field: Viridis-scale stabilization field

6. Conclusion
The simulation confirms that:
QBE and CIMM predict observable, structured phenomena
Matter, time, gravity, and dark matter can all be modeled as emergent
Collapse-entropy regulation can yield realistic cosmological dynamics
Next step: Extend to 3D field geometry and track curvature evolution over time.
