## §1. Natural Law Representation

The Dawn Field Theory and its associated models are representations of underlying physical and informational processes. As such, they are intended to simulate and formalize **natural law**, not to encode proprietary algorithms or technologies.

No patent, trademark, or exclusive commercial claim may be made on any process, function, or output that emerges directly from this natural law model.

---

## §2. Inheritance of Constraints

Any derivative, fork, reimplementation, or reframing of this framework must inherit these constraints:

- Derivatives must remain open and freely accessible under equivalent or stronger copyleft terms.
- No proprietary enclosures or closed-source derivatives of the theory itself are permitted.
- Extensions that encapsulate, obfuscate, or repackage this model into non-open systems are considered license violations.

---

## §3. Distinction Between Theory and Application

This repository distinguishes between:
- **The Theory Layer**: Representations of recursive balance, entropic collapse, field dynamics, and herniation geometries. These are bound to natural law and must remain free, transparent, and non-proprietary.
- **The Devkit/Application Layer**: Tools, APIs, and interface components that interact with the theory. These may be governed by separate licenses and may include patentable mechanisms *only if* they do not enclose, redefine, or privatize the theory layer.

---

## §4. Future-Proofing

This appendix may be revised in the future to:
- Add clarity to the distinction between natural processes and applied tools
- Extend protection across additional simulation modalities or field implementations
- Respond to misuse or attempted enclosure by clarifying legal recourse

---

## §5. Citation and Attribution

All use of this framework must include explicit attribution to its original author(s) and repository. Citations must reference the repository URL and commit hash or version ID where applicable.
