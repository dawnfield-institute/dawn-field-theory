## §1. Natural Law and Symbolic Integrity

This repository expresses models of symbolic entropy collapse, recursive balance, and field dynamics. These are abstract representations of natural informational structures. As such:

* No patent or exclusive claim may be made on processes that directly reflect these models.
* These representations must remain free from proprietary enclosure.

## §2. Recursive Derivatives

All forks, adaptations, or reframings must preserve symbolic accessibility:

* Must remain fully open source under equivalent or stronger copyleft.
* May not obfuscate, privatize, or limit epistemic access to any symbolic theory layer.
* Must include recursive traceability: links back to this repository and its epistemic evolution.

## §3. Separation of Layers

Two epistemic strata govern this repository:

* **The Theory Layer**: Symbolic, recursive, and entropic formal systems. These must remain public, license-bound, and unmodified in intent.
* **The Application Layer**: May include experimental APIs, devkits, or tools. Derivative licenses here are permitted *only if* the Theory Layer remains untouched and free.

## §4. Institutional Stewardship

This license is governed by **The Dawn Field Institute**. As the steward of Dawn Field Theory, the Institute maintains legal and symbolic authority over the proper use of this framework. Violations of this appendix may result in revocation of access or community-based censure.

## §5. Attribution Requirements

All public or private use of this framework must include:

* Full attribution to **Peter Groom, The Dawn Field Institute**
* Direct citation of the relevant repository URL and commit ID
* Labeling of downstream work as **recursive derivatives**, if applicable

## Navigation

* [MISSION.md](./MISSION.md)

This appendix preserves symbolic clarity, epistemic recursion, and the integrity of a recursive cognitive lattice.
