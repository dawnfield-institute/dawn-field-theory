# üß™ Dawn Field Theory: A Guide for AI Research Labs

Welcome to **Dawn Field Theory** ‚Äî a living research framework at the intersection of AI, physics, information theory, and emergent intelligence. This repository is designed for AI labs seeking to explore, validate, and extend the frontiers of machine intelligence, recursive learning, and entropy-driven computation.

---

## üöÄ Why This Repo Matters for AI Labs

- **Unified Theory & Practice:** Dawn Field Theory bridges deep theoretical models (entropy, collapse, field intelligence) with executable code and reproducible experiments.
- **Open Science & Reflexivity:** All research is open, versioned, and designed for reflexive improvement ‚Äî ideal for collaborative lab environments.
- **AI-Native Comprehension Protocols:** The Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) enables machine-native benchmarking of AI understanding, supporting research in explainability and epistemic validation.

## üß† Core Experiments

Explore the [`foundational/experiments/`](foundational/experiments/README.md) directory for hands-on simulations:

- **Recursive Gravity:** Emergent galactic/superfluid structures via recursive field modeling.
- **Symbolic Trees & Fractals:** Experiments in symbolic emergence, bifractal expansion, and entropy-driven pruning.
- **Pi Harmonics & Hodge Conjecture:** Symbolic resonance and topological collapse simulations, including links to mathematical conjectures.
- **Language-to-Logic:** Translating natural language into symbolic logic using recursive entropy regulation.
- **Legacy Simulations:** Early models (`brain.py`, `cosmo.py`, `vcpu.py`) demonstrating entropic intelligence, cosmogenesis, and emergent logic.

Each experiment is documented with protocols, reference materials, and results ‚Äî ready for lab replication or extension.

## üìÑ Research Papers & Whitepapers

The [`foundational/legacy_docs_archive/`](foundational/legacy_docs_archive/) contains preprints and whitepapers, including:

- **AI, Quantum Measurement, and the Fabric of Reality:** Proposes AI as an active participant in quantum measurement, exploring energy-to-information conversion and the emergence of time.
- **Quantum Balance Equation (QBE):** Introduces a mathematical framework for energy-information exchange, with AI-driven measurement and entropy regulation.
- **CIMM & GAIA Papers:** Document the evolution from the legacy AGI prototype (CIMM) to the next-gen GAIA architecture, including applications in cryptography, cosmology, and scientific discovery.
- **Dissertation Drafts:** In-depth theoretical and empirical analysis of entropy-aware AI, recursive learning, and AGI governance.

These documents are ideal for labs interested in theoretical grounding, experimental design, and interdisciplinary research.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Code & Models

- [`models/CIMM/`](models/CIMM/README.md): The **Cosmic Information Mining Model** ‚Äî a legacy AGI engine for entropy-informed agentic systems. The prime number structure experiment is operational; GPU enablement is in progress, and finance modeling experiments are temporarily offline during this transition.
- [`models/GAIA/`](models/GAIA/README.md): The **GAIA architecture** ‚Äî currently in the architecture and early development stage. Internal prototyping is ongoing; no runnable implementation is available yet.
- [`cognition_index_protocol/`](cognition_index_protocol/): The **CIP** ‚Äî a protocol for embedding, testing, and validating AI comprehension within codebases, supporting reflexive feedback and machine-native epistemology.

All code is modular, documented, and designed for adaptation to new research questions.

## üß¨ How AI Labs Can Use This Repo

- **Benchmark New AI Models:** Use the experiments and CIP to test the epistemic depth of novel architectures.
- **Extend Theoretical Models:** Build on QBE, CIMM, or GAIA for new research in entropy, field intelligence, or symbolic emergence.
- **Collaborative Research:** Fork, contribute, or propose new experiments ‚Äî the repo is structured for open, iterative science.
- **AI Safety & Explainability:** Study the governance, transparency, and alignment protocols embedded throughout the project.
