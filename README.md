## üöÄ Latest Advances (2025)

- **Adaptive, feedback-driven neural models**: New experiments (see `test.py`, `blueprints/AI_detection/`) demonstrate self-modifying architectures that grow/prune in response to entropy and feedback, addressing the blackbox ML problem.
- **Empirical validation pipeline**: Protocol-driven, timestamped experiments now align symbolic collapse, memory, and erasure with quantum and thermodynamic theory.
- **Transparency metrics**: Fractal dimension, entropy, and neuron activity are tracked and visualized, making learning interpretable.
- **Open, auditable protocols**: All code and results are documented for reproducibility and peer review.

> **Interdisciplinary by Design:**  
> Dawn Field Theory is built at the intersection of AI, physics, information theory, and symbolic logic.  
> This cross-disciplinary approach enables new paradigms in intelligence research, simulation, and epistemology.

---

## üåü Status: Public Anchor Phase (WIP)

This repository is currently in **Phase 1: Public Anchor**.  
Documents, metadata, and simulation structures are being migrated from internal prototypes. Expect frequent updates.

üìÖ See [`timeline.md`](./timeline.md) for a development roadmap.

---

## üö© 2025 Progress & Workflow Update

**Recent advances:**

* Symbolic bifractal collapse validated in 3D simulations
* Recursive entropy/collapse trees confirm symbolic geometry and adaptive pruning
* Proto-galactic superfluid modeled from recursive information fields (no Newtonian force)
* Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) introduced for machine-native benchmarking
* Unified entropy as substrate across quantum and classical regimes

**Development workflow:**

* Code dev during the week (simulation core, protocol logic, cognitive models)
* Experimental runs and theory reviews on weekends

---

## üß¨ What Is This?

Dawn is a post-symbolic intelligence framework built on the idea that:

> Intelligence is not computation ‚Äî it is recursive collapse regulation.

It models cognition through:

* Entropy-monitoring feedback systems
* Quantum Potential Layer (QPL) dynamics
* Superfluid coherence and symbolic turbulence
* Collapse-based learning algorithms

---

## üîç Core Focus Areas

* Recursive balance field mechanics
* Collapse geometry and entropic boundaries
* Dual field herniation and symbolic locking
* Post-stoic Schr√∂dinger environments
* Natural law simulation at symbolic resolution

---

## üß† Infodynamics ‚Äì A New Paradigm

**Infodynamics** is Dawn‚Äôs root layer:

> Structure emerges from entropy via recursive collapse and field alignment.

## üß† CIMM: Legacy AGI Prototype (Sunset)

CIMM (Cosmic Information Mining Model) was the first entropy-informed agentic system.  
Currently, the prime number structure experiment is operational. GPU enablement is in progress, and some finance modeling experiments are temporarily offline during this transition.  
Now preserved as a historical AGI engine.

## üåç GAIA: Next-Generation Field Intelligence

GAIA (Generalized Architectures for Intelligent Actualization) extends Dawn Field into:

* Symbolic memory systems
* Meta-cognitive trace protocols
* Resonant agentic cognition

> **Note:** GAIA is in the architecture and early development stage. Internal prototyping is ongoing; no runnable implementation is available yet.
