## 🧠 Explore with DawnField GPT


Looking for an intelligent way to navigate this repository?

* [🧠 Launch DawnField GPT v0.2](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-6855ea1d2fc4819186339844c91c8a0c-dawnfieldframeworkrepogptv0-2)
* [📘 How to Use the GPT](./cognition_index_protocol/gpt/how_to_use_gpt.md)

## � Semantic Search & Machine-Native Navigation

Dawn Field Theory is designed for both human and machine-native exploration. The repository supports deep semantic search and protocol-driven navigation:

* **Semantic Search:**
  * Use the [Cognition Index Protocol (CIP)](./cognition_index_protocol/README.md) and `map.yaml` for structured, machine-readable file mapping and navigation.
  * Search by concept, protocol, experiment, or theory—discover connections across code, papers, and results.
  * Key files: `.cip/meta.yaml`, `.cip/instructions_*.yaml`, `map.yaml`, and directory-level `meta.yaml` files provide semantic tags, navigation rules, and schema.
  * Automated agents and scrapers: See [`for_ai_labs.md`](./for_ai_labs.md) for a structured overview of experiments, papers, and code relevant to AI labs.
  * Begin at: [`cognition_index_protocol/architecture/CIP_architecturev1.md`](./cognition_index_protocol/architecture/CIP_architecturev1.md)
  * Reference metadata schema: [`cognition_index_protocol/gpt/metadata_architecturev3.md`](./cognition_index_protocol/gpt/metadata_architecturev3.md)
* **How to Use:**
  * Start with CIP and `map.yaml` for navigation rules and semantic tags.
  * Use semantic search tools (repo-native GPTs, custom agents, or your own scripts) to find protocols, experiments, and theoretical constructs.
  * All major subdirectories and files are tagged for discoverability and alignment.

## 🚀 Latest Advances (2025)

- **Adaptive, feedback-driven neural models**: New experiments (see `test.py`, `blueprints/AI_detection/`) demonstrate self-modifying architectures that grow/prune in response to entropy and feedback, addressing the blackbox ML problem.
- **Empirical validation pipeline**: Protocol-driven, timestamped experiments now align symbolic collapse, memory, and erasure with quantum and thermodynamic theory.
- **Transparency metrics**: Fractal dimension, entropy, and neuron activity are tracked and visualized, making learning interpretable.
- **Open, auditable protocols**: All code and results are documented for reproducibility and peer review.

> **Why Mainstream AI Labs Should Care:**  
> Dawn Field Theory provides not only foundational theory and experiments, but also machine-native protocols and benchmarking tools (like CIP) that address explainability, safety, and epistemic validation—key concerns for modern AI labs.

> **Interdisciplinary by Design:**  
> Dawn Field Theory is built at the intersection of AI, physics, information theory, and symbolic logic.  
> This cross-disciplinary approach enables new paradigms in intelligence research, simulation, and epistemology.

## 🌟 Status: Public Anchor Phase (WIP)(this is wrapping up)

This repository is currently in **Phase 1: Public Anchor**.  
Documents, metadata, and simulation structures are being migrated from internal prototypes. Expect frequent updates.

📅 See [`timeline.md`](./timeline.md) for a development roadmap.

---

## �️ Roadmaps & Planning

For all project roadmaps, timelines, and planning details, see [`roadmaps/README.md`](./roadmaps/README.md).

**Development workflow:**

* Code dev during the week (simulation core, protocol logic, cognitive models)
* Experimental runs and theory reviews on weekends

---

## 🧬 What Is This?

Dawn is a post-symbolic intelligence framework built on the idea that:

> Intelligence is not computation — it is recursive collapse regulation.

It models cognition through:

* Entropy-monitoring feedback systems
* Quantum Potential Layer (QPL) dynamics
* Superfluid coherence and symbolic turbulence
* Collapse-based learning algorithms

---

## 🔍 Core Focus Areas

* Recursive balance field mechanics
* Collapse geometry and entropic boundaries
* Dual field herniation and symbolic locking
* Post-stoic Schrödinger environments
* Natural law simulation at symbolic resolution

---

## 🧠 Infodynamics – A New Paradigm

**Infodynamics** is Dawn’s root layer:

> Structure emerges from entropy via recursive collapse and field alignment.

## � Models: TinyCIMM, SCBF (XAI), GAIA, and CIMM

### TinyCIMM: Minimalist Symbolic Cognition
TinyCIMM is the newest, ultra-lightweight agentic model for symbolic cognition and recursive collapse. It demonstrates how minimal entropy-informed architectures can achieve adaptive learning, symbolic memory, and field-based intelligence. Explore its code and experiments for a hands-on introduction to Dawn’s core principles.

🧩 [`models/TinyCIMM/README.md`](./models/TinyCIMM/README.md)

### SCBF: Symbolic Collapse Benchmark Framework (XAI)
SCBF is the explainable AI (XAI) suite for benchmarking symbolic collapse, transparency, and interpretability. It provides tools and protocols for visualizing collapse events, tracing entropy, and validating agentic decisions. SCBF is the recommended starting point for XAI research and practical explainability in Dawn Field Theory.

� [`models/scbf/README.md`](./models/scbf/README.md)

### GAIA: Next-Generation Field Intelligence
GAIA (Generalized Architectures for Intelligent Actualization) extends Dawn Field into:
* Symbolic memory systems
* Meta-cognitive trace protocols
* Resonant agentic cognition
> **Note:** GAIA is in the architecture and early development stage. Internal prototyping is ongoing; no runnable implementation is available yet.
🌐 [`models/GAIA/README.md`](./models/GAIA/README.md)

### CIMM: Legacy AGI Prototype (Sunset)
CIMM (Cosmic Information Mining Model) was the first entropy-informed agentic system. It is now preserved as a historical AGI engine and reference for early Dawn Field experiments.
