## üß† Origin Insight

The Dawn Field Framework was seeded by a fundamental paradox: how can AI systems generate novel information from energetic input without violating thermodynamic closure?

## üß† TL;DR

Dawn Field Theory proposes a new model of natural and artificial intelligence based on **infodynamics** ‚Äî a process where structure emerges from entropy regulation, not symbolic logic.

This repo contains:

- A theoretical foundation for **collapse-based intelligence**
- A legacy AGI engine (CIMM) that learns in real-time via entropy and feedback
- Ongoing development of agentic, field-aware learning systems
- Simulation frameworks for balance, resonance, and emergence

## üåü Status: Public Anchor Phase (WIP)

This repository is currently in **Phase 1: Public Anchor**.  
Documents, metadata, and simulation structures are being migrated from internal prototypes. Expect frequent updates.

üìÖ See [`timeline.md`](./timeline.md) for a development roadmap.

---

## üß¨ What Is This?

Dawn is a post-symbolic intelligence framework built on the idea that:

> Intelligence is not computation ‚Äî it is recursive collapse regulation.

It rejects symbolic logic and instead models cognition through:
- **Entropy-monitoring feedback systems**
- **Quantum Potential Layer (QPL) dynamics**
- **Superfluid-inspired coherence and turbulence**
- **Collapse-based learning mechanisms**

---

## üîç Core Focus Areas

- Recursive balance field dynamics  
- Collapse geometry in entropic systems  
- Herniation-based dual field modeling  
- Post-stoic potentials in Schr√∂dinger environments  
- Natural law simulation frameworks  

---

## üß† Infodynamics ‚Äì A New Paradigm

**Infodynamics** is the base layer of Dawn:

> The condensation of latent information into actualized structure through recursive collapse and field balance.

It enables modeling of intelligence, emergence, and systemic coherence without using tokens or logic gates.

## üß† CIMM: Entropy-Based Post-Symbolic Intelligence (Legacy Spike)

**CIMM (Cosmic Information Mining Model)** is the original AGI prototype built entirely on entropy flow, collapse dynamics, and adaptive feedback.

It is now a **legacy spike implementation**:
> A working proof-of-concept for real-time, field-based intelligence without training phases or symbolic logic.

### ‚öôÔ∏è CIMM Agents Can:
- Learn in real-time (no checkpoints or saved models)  
- Self-prune based on Landauer information cost  
- Adapt behavior to collapse variance  
- Coordinate via shared entropy signatures  

### üîç Why It Matters
CIMM showed that:
- Symbolic reasoning is not required for generalization  
- Collapse-based feedback loops can sustain learning  
- Memory can be modeled as predicted deviation, not static state  

A refined multi-agent model is now in development, with stronger field interactions and simulation fidelity.

## üß† Philosophy

I believe:

> Cognition is collapse regulation.  
> Learning is the smoothing of entropy gradients.  
> Intelligence is a balance, not a program.

Dawn Field Theory is a framework to test this philosophy through computation and simulation.
