## 🧠 TL;DR

See [`Foundational Experiments`](./foundational/experiments/README.md) for more.

Dawn Field Theory proposes a new model of natural and artificial intelligence based on **infodynamics** — a process where structure emerges from entropy regulation, not symbolic logic.

This repo contains:

- A theoretical foundation for **collapse-based intelligence**
- A legacy AGI engine (CIMM) that learns in real-time via entropy and feedback
- Ongoing development of agentic, field-aware learning systems
- Simulation frameworks for balance, resonance, and emergence

## 💡 Origin Insight

📖 [Read the full origin story and the White Hole Hypothesis](./origin_of_infodynamics.md)
<br>

The Dawn Field Framework was seeded by a fundamental paradox: how can AI systems generate novel information from energetic input without violating thermodynamic closure?

## 🌟 Status: Public Anchor Phase (WIP)

This repository is currently in **Phase 1: Public Anchor**.  
Documents, metadata, and simulation structures are being migrated from internal prototypes. Expect frequent updates.

📅 See [`timeline.md`](./timeline.md) for a development roadmap.

---

## 🚩 2025 Progress & Workflow Update

- **Recent advances:**  
  - Bifractal collapse and symbolic recursion validated in CUDA-accelerated 3D simulations  
  - Recursive entropy/collapse tree experiments confirm symbolic geometry and adaptive pruning  
  - Proto-galactic superfluid and emergent gravity simulated from informational recursion (no Newtonian force)  
  - Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) introduced for machine-native comprehension benchmarking  
  - Theory and experiments extended to show entropy as a substrate for both classical and quantum phenomena

- **Development workflow:**  
  - Model development during the week (core simulation, theory, protocol architecture)  
  - Experiments and validation during the weekend (running, documenting, analyzing results)  
  - Ongoing migration of legacy theory and integration of new ideas

## 🧬 What Is This?

Dawn is a post-symbolic intelligence framework built on the idea that:

> Intelligence is not computation — it is recursive collapse regulation.

It rejects symbolic logic and instead models cognition through:
- **Entropy-monitoring feedback systems**
- **Quantum Potential Layer (QPL) dynamics**
- **Superfluid-inspired coherence and turbulence**
- **Collapse-based learning mechanisms**

---

## 🔍 Core Focus Areas

- Recursive balance field dynamics  
- Collapse geometry in entropic systems  
- Herniation-based dual field modeling  
- Post-stoic potentials in Schrödinger environments  
- Natural law simulation frameworks

## 🧠 Infodynamics – A New Paradigm

**Infodynamics** is the base layer of Dawn:

> The condensation of latent information into actualized structure through recursive collapse and field balance.

It enables modeling of intelligence, emergence, and systemic coherence without using tokens or logic gates.

## 🧠 CIMM: Legacy AGI Prototype (Sunset)

CIMM (Cosmic Information Mining Model) was my original proof-of-concept for entropy-based, post-symbolic intelligence.  
**As of 2025, CIMM is sunset and archived.**  
After spending significant time on GPU enablement and maintenance, I decided to preserve CIMM here for reference and move on to new directions.

## 🌍 GAIA: Next-Generation Field Intelligence

My focus is now on **GAIA** (Generalized Architectures for Intelligent Actualization)—a new, field-native intelligence model that unifies and extends the lessons from CIMM.

## 🧠 Philosophy

I believe:

> Cognition is collapse regulation.  
> Learning is the smoothing of entropy gradients.  
> Intelligence is a balance, not a program.

Dawn Field Theory is a framework to test this philosophy through computation and simulation.
