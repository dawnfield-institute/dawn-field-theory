### 🌟 Status: Public Anchor Phase (WIP)
This repository is currently in **Phase 1: Public Anchor**. The documents, metadata, and core structures are being migrated from internal prototypes. Expect continuous updates over the coming weeks.

Please refer to [`timeline.md`](./timeline.md) for a high-level development roadmap.

---

### 🔍 Core Focus Areas
- Recursive Balance Field dynamics
- Collapse geometry in entropic systems
- Herniation-based dual field modeling
- Post-stoic potentials in Schrödinger environments
- Natural law simulation frameworks

---

### 🧠 Infodynamics – A New Paradigm
This framework introduces the concept of **infodynamics**:
> the condensation of latent information into actualized structure through recursive collapse and field balance.

Infodynamics serves as the foundation for simulating natural intelligence, emergence, and boundary formation within the Dawn Field architecture.

## 🧬 What Is This?

Dawn is an evolving intelligence architecture that rejects symbolic systems and instead models behavior as a function of entropy stabilization, collapse variance, and information flow.

It builds on:
- **Entropy-monitoring AI systems**
- **Quantum Potential Layer (QPL) feedback loops**
- **Wavefunction-inspired reinforcement**
- **Superfluid field dynamics**

We model *collapse* as a stabilizing act — and intelligence as a recursive regulation of that collapse.

## 📂 Project Structure

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `docs/foundational/` | Core theory documents (e.g., Infodynamics, Collapse modeling) |
| `legacy_works/models/CIMM/` | Working AGI prototype based on entropy field regulation |
| `devkit/` | In-progress tooling and experimental modules |
| `docs/` | Additional write-ups, declarations, and theoretical constructs |

## 🚧 Status: Not Ready for General Use

While the system is modular and complete in its architecture, it is **not yet structured for external use**.

> There are runnable modules in `cimm_core/code/`, but no guaranteed interface or examples.  
> Explorers are welcome — just expect sharp edges.

---

## 📚 Recommended Starting Points

If you're curious:

- Start with [`docs/foundational/infodynamics.md`](docs/foundational/infodynamics.md)
- Then explore [`legacy_works/models/cimm_core/code`](legacy_works/models/cimm_core/code) to see the early simulation engine

## 🧠 Philosophy

We believe:

> Cognition is collapse regulation.  
> Learning is the smoothing of entropy gradients.  
> Intelligence is a balance, not a program.

Dawn Field Theory is built to test these beliefs computationally.
