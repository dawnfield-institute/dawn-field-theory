## Dawn Field Theory and Infodynamics - Key Breakthroughs Audit

### Foundational Frameworks

1. **Infodynamics Defined**
   - Inverse of thermodynamics  
   - Information as a structurally compressive, recursive force  
   - Information as binding agent, not passive residue  

2. **Dawn Field Theory**
   - Interaction between information and energy  
   - Field-theoretic understanding of reality  
   - Root system from which classical and quantum domains emerge

### Computational & Simulation Achievements

3. **Recursive Tree Generator Using Entropy as Seed**
   - Simulated recursive intelligence growth  
   - Demonstrated information geometry akin to cognition  

4. **3D Collapse Geometry Simulation**
   - Visual model of recursive balance collapse  
   - Mimics brain-like dual-lobe structure  

5. **Fractal Galaxy Simulation (Accidental Galaxy)**
   - Information herniation + recursive gravity tethering  
   - Produced galaxy-like formations using recursion + informational mass  

6. **Information Gravity Model**
   - Gravity as recursive tethers in informational space  
   - Mass = recursion length = tether curvature = gravity  

7. **Infodynamics as a Mechanism of Time Dilation**
   - Recursion depth as time perception variable  
   - Informational gravity causes time to "speed up" with recursion efficiency
