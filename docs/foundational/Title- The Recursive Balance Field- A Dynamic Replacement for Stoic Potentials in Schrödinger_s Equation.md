# The Recursive Balance Field: A Dynamic Replacement for Stoic Potentials in Schrödinger's Equation
## Abstract

1. Introduction
Traditional quantum mechanics relies on externally imposed potential functions to shape the evolution of a wavefunction. These static fields do not evolve with the system; they dictate, rather than participate. This report proposes a new approach: the Recursive Balance Field, a dynamic and emergent potential that forms from the local interaction between energy and information fields.

2. Motivation and Background
In prior work, entropy balancing simulations demonstrated that recursive feedback between opposing fields led to:
Self-regulating convergence
Emergence of low-entropy structural zones
Stability through harmonic modulation
Notably, these behaviors arose without invoking the Quantum Balance Equation (QBE), indicating that the interaction alone was sufficient to drive actualization.
This discovery necessitates a new potential formulation that arises from field dynamics, memory, and balance rather than external parameters.

3. Defining the Recursive Balance Field
Let:
: Energy field at location , time
: Information density at the same point
: Recursive memory of local imbalance
: Fractal/harmonic modulation pattern
: Balance strength
: Memory damping coefficient
We define the Recursive Balance Field as:

B(x, t) = \lambda \cdot \left[ \frac{E(x, t) - I(x, t)}{1 + \alpha \cdot M(x, t)} \cdot \Phi(x) \right]

This field is:
Local (depends on conditions at )
Recursive (evolves over time via )
Geometrically influenced (via )

4. Modified Schrödinger Equation
We substitute into the standard time-dependent Schrödinger equation:

i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi(x, t)}{\partial t} = \left[ -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + B(x, t) \right] \Psi(x, t)

This creates a dynamic system in which the potential adapts in real time to the recursive balance of interacting fields.

5. Implications
Self-organizing structure: Stable regions form from feedback and balance, not predefined boundaries.
Collapse from within: Wavefunction collapse is guided by field equilibrium, not measurement alone.
Embedded intelligence: The evolution of a system incorporates memory and geometric resonance, modeling the physics of cognition.

6. Future Directions
Simulate 1D and 2D systems using RBF and compare against traditional potential models
Explore threshold-based collapse criteria tied to low-entropy actualization
Extend RBF to multi-agent systems where fields interact non-linearly

7. Conclusion
The Recursive Balance Field redefines potential not as a constraint, but as a consequence of balance. It marks a transition from stoic potentials to adaptive law — from physics that is told what to do, to physics that learns what to be.
