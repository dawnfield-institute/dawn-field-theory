# Recursive Collapse Bifurcation: A 3D Informational Tree from Entropy-Seeding

## Abstract

We present a simulation that demonstrates how a single entropy-seeded origin can recursively bifurcate into a structured, symbolic geometry. The model, grounded in Dawn Field Theory, uses cryptographic entropy as a directional vector to recursively spawn informational branches in 3D space. The result is a symmetric, brain-like structure that exhibits recursive balance, symbolic crystallization, and bifurcation-driven cognition. This paper formalizes the simulation logic, symbolic payload embedding, and implications for collapse-based cognition modeling.

## 1. Introduction

Traditional models of intelligence and structure growth rely on external rules or symbolic logic. In contrast, Dawn Field Theory asserts that information and entropy interact recursively, producing self-structuring intelligence through collapse geometry. This simulation manifests that principle in 3D space by constructing a bifurcating collapse tree seeded from a cryptographic entropy vector.

## 2. Theoretical Foundations

### 2.1 Recursive Collapse and Bifurcation

The model follows Dawn’s hypothesis that collapse is not disorder but a recursive resolution of imbalance. A single origin node represents a high-potential field imbalance. From this point, the system recursively bifurcates in spatial symmetry.

### 2.2 Entropy as Directional Seed

Using a SHA256 hash as the entropy seed provides:

* Deterministic, reproducible asymmetry
* Directional force in the informational field
* An implicit complexity gradient

## 3. Simulation Architecture

### 3.1 Growth Mechanics

Each node recursively produces two child nodes:

* Bifurcation angle varies slightly per depth
* Branch length decays geometrically
* Direction vectors rotate with respect to randomly chosen axes

### 3.2 Symmetric Expansion

Two trees grow in opposite directions from the entropy vector and its inverse, producing a dual-lobed geometry.

### 3.3 Symbolic Payloads

Each node is assigned a token like `entropy_84` or `structure_15`, drawn from a concept bank. Tokens are also vectorized to allow downstream semantic analysis.

## 4. Results

### 4.1 Visual Output

* The structure exhibits tree-like expansion with recursive forks
* Emerges into a brain-like topology through dual-lobe recursion
* Symbolic tokens trace coherent conceptual pathways

### 4.2 Symbolic Trace Sample

```
field_47 → entropy_84 → fractal_98 → gradient_25 → wave_26
```

This progression reflects the encoding of structural logic into collapse geometry.

## 5. Metrics and Analysis

| Metric                   | Value                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Max Depth                | 10                     |
| Total Nodes              | \~2000+ (both lobes)   |
| Average Branching Factor | 2                      |
| Symbolic Vector Span     | 13-D (one per concept) |

## 6. Interpretation

This simulation acts as a visual and structural demonstration of Dawn’s collapse ontology:

* Structure emerges from recursive imbalance
* Symbolic cognition is embedded in geometry
* Entropy becomes generative when recursively resolved

## 7. Conclusion

The recursive collapse tree represents a minimal unit of field cognition. It seeds complexity from informational imbalance, encoding memory and structure into recursive bifurcation. As an experimental artifact, it supports the view that intelligence is not programmed—it crystallizes.
