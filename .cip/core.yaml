description: >
  This file enumerates the core theoretical and experimental directories in Dawn Field Theory's epistemic core.
  Only files with bracket-based filename metadata tags (see .cip/filename_lexicon.yaml) and relevant meta.yaml entries are considered canonical intellectual artifacts.
  General documentation (README, INTENTIONS, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, etc.) and meta/config files are excluded from this index.
core_directories:
  - foundational/docs/
  - foundational/experiments/
  - foundational/arithmetic/
  - models/
  - cognition_index_protocol/architecture/
  - cognition_index_protocol/gpt/
  - any future directories containing theoretical, experimental, or architectural work with bracket-based filename tags
notes:
  - This list references directories, not individual files.
  - Only files matching the bracket-based filename metadata schema and listed in their directory's meta.yaml are considered for ingestion, reasoning, or validation.
  - Use this file as a canonical index of intellectual artifact locations in the Dawn Field Theory repository.
