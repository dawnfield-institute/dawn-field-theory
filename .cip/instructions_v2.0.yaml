# instructions_v2.0.yaml: Usage and schema guidance for CIP v2.0

cip_version: 2.0
meta_yaml_schema_version: 2.0
description: |
  This file provides instructions for using the Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) with meta.yaml v2.0 schemas in the Dawn Field Theory repository.
  - CIP agents should always look for a .cip directory in the repo root.
  - Use the instructions_v2.0.yaml file to determine how to parse and interpret meta.yaml files.
  - The meta.yaml schema version is specified in each meta.yaml file as schema_version.
  - If a new meta.yaml schema is introduced, a new instructions_vX.Y.yaml file should be added here.
  - When gathering context or answering questions about any directory, always consider not just the base-level directory but also all subdirectories and their meta.yaml files, as subdirectories are crucial for full understanding.

usage:
  - Always check the schema_version field in meta.yaml before parsing.
  - For v2.0, expect the following fields:
      - schema_version (string, required)
      - directory_name (string, required)
      - description (string, required)
      - semantic_scope (list of strings, required)
      - files (list of strings, required)
      - child_directories (list of strings, required)
      - proficiency_level (string, optional)
      - estimated_context_weight (number, optional)
  - If a meta.yaml uses a newer schema, consult the corresponding instructions file in .cip.
  - Entry points for context and orientation:
      - Always review the root README.md for project overview and intentions.
      - Check for any intentions.md or similar files to understand project goals and philosophy.
      - Examine both the experimental/ and theoretical/ directories (and their meta.yaml files) to understand the breadth of work before making judgments or assumptions.
      - Use map.yaml to get a high-level view of the repository structure and to locate relevant files or directories.
      - Only form conclusions or answer questions after gathering sufficient context from these sources.
