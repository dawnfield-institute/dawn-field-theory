# 🧑‍💻 DevKit Directory

Welcome to the **Developer Toolkit** of Dawn Field Theory! 👩‍💻🧑‍🔬 This directory offers a practical set of experimental modules, tests, and utilities that support and validate core theoretical components. It’s the proving ground for concepts, the sandbox for exploration, and the springboard for implementation.

## 🚀 Recent Advances (2025)

- **New experimental modules**: Includes adaptive, feedback-driven neural models and entropy-aware algorithms for explainable AI.
- **Transparency and metrics**: DevKit tools now track entropy, fractal dimension, and neuron activity for deeper insight and interpretability.
- **Protocol integration**: All experiments are now aligned with the Cognition Index Protocol (CIP) for reproducibility and open science.

## 🧪 Purpose

The `devkit/` is your go-to environment for:

* 🔬 Prototyping symbolic and entropic algorithms
* 🧱 Stress-testing field theoretic principles
* 🧠 Bridging abstract theory with executable tools

Whether you're debugging entropy fields or visualizing recursive collapses, this is your developer's playground! 🛠️✨
