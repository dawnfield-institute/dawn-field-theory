# 🧰 DevKit Directory

Welcome to the **Developer Toolkit** of Dawn Field Theory! 👩‍💻👨‍🔬 This directory offers a practical set of experimental modules, tests, and utilities that support and validate core theoretical components. It’s the proving ground for concepts, the sandbox for exploration, and the springboard for implementation.

## 📁 Contents

* `compression/` – 🔄 Tests for entropic compression methods and symbolic information reduction strategies.
* `hash_evaluation/` – 🧪 Tools like SELID (Symbolic Entropy Leak Identifier) for evaluating information integrity and symbolic structure.
* `random_number/` – 🎲 Experiments in entropy-balanced random number generation for symbolic modeling.

## 🧭 Purpose

The `devkit/` is your go-to environment for:

* 🔬 Prototyping symbolic and entropic algorithms
* 🧱 Stress-testing field theoretic principles
* 🧠 Bridging abstract theory with executable tools

Whether you're debugging entropy fields or visualizing recursive collapses, this is your developer's playground! 🛠️✨
