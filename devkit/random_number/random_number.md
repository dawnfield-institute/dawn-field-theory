## Overview
This experiment evaluates the performance and randomness of a **Quantum-Inspired Random Number Generator (QRNG)** implemented in the `MaximumChaosQRNG` class. The QRNG leverages quantum-inspired principles such as **wavefunction collapse** and **chaos maximization** to generate high-entropy random numbers. The results are compared against Python's built-in RNG and NumPy's RNG.

## Key Components

### 1. Quantum-Inspired RNG (`MaximumChaosQRNG`)
- **Initialization**: Creates a normalized complex wavefunction (superposition) as the starting state.
- **Chaos Injection**: Applies iterative chaos injection using random phases and amplitudes to evolve the wavefunction.
- **Wavefunction Collapse**: Simulates Schrödinger-style collapse to extract random values based on probability amplitudes.
- **Hashing**: Uses the BLAKE3 hash function to ensure randomness and scalability.

### 2. Randomness Evaluation
The QRNG is evaluated using statistical metrics:
- Shannon Entropy
- Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test
- Chi-Square Test

### 3. Comparison with Other RNGs
Benchmarked against:
- Python's Built-in RNG
- NumPy's RNG

## Experiment Design

### 1. Randomness Metrics
- Generates 1,000 samples from each RNG and evaluates their randomness using mean, standard deviation, entropy, and statistical tests.

### 2. Averaged Randomness Tests
- Runs the randomness tests 5 times and computes average metrics for the QRNG.

### 3. Histogram Visualization
- Visualizes the distributions of random numbers generated by all RNGs for side-by-side comparison.

---

## Results Summary
- The QRNG demonstrates high entropy and uniformity, comparable to or exceeding Python's and NumPy's RNGs.
- Statistical tests confirm the randomness of the QRNG output.
- Histograms show no visible clustering or bias.

## How to Run the Experiment
1. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install numpy scipy matplotlib blake3
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```powershell
   python RandomNumberTest.py
   ```
3. Observe the console output for metrics and view the histograms.

## Key Takeaways
- The QRNG leverages quantum-inspired principles to generate high-quality random numbers.
- Statistical tests and visualizations validate the randomness of the QRNG output.
- The experiment provides a robust comparison of QRNG with traditional RNGs.
